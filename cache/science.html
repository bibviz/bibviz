<p><b><a href="../gen/sci_list.html">Genesis</a></b>
<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../gen/sci.html" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p><li>"In the beginning" <br>
<a href="../interp/universe.html">When was the universe created?</a><br> 
<a href="../interp/gap.html">The Gap Theory</a>  <a href="../gen/1.html#1">1:1-2</a>

<p><li>The Genesis 1 creation account conflicts with the order of events that are known to science. In 
Genesis, the earth is created before light and stars, birds and whales before reptiles and insects,
and flowering plants before any animals. The order of events known from science is just the 
opposite. <a href="../gen/1.html#1">1:1-2:3</a>

<p><li>God creates light and separates light from darkness, and day from night, on the first day.
Yet he didn't make the light producing objects (the sun and the stars) until the fourth day
(<a href="../gen/1.html#14">1:14-19</a>). And how could there be "the evening and the morning" on the 
first day if there was no sun to mark them? <a href="../gen/1.html#3">1:3-5</a>

<p><li>God spends one-sixth of his entire creative effort (the second day) 
working on a solid firmament. This strange structure, which God calls heaven, is 
intended to separate the higher waters from the lower waters.  <a href="../gen/1.html#6">1:6-8</a>

<p><li>Plants are made on the third day before there was a sun to drive their photosynthetic
processes (<a href="../gen/1.html#14">1:14-19</a>).  <a href="../gen/1.html#11">1:11</a>

<p><li>God lets &quot;the earth bring forth&quot; the plants, rather than creating them directly. 
Maybe Genesis is not so anti-evolution after all. <a href="../gen/1.html#11">1:11</a>

<p><li> In an apparent endorsement of astrology, God places the sun, moon, and stars in the firmament so that they can be used
"for signs". This, of course, is exactly what astrologers do: read "the signs" in the Zodiac in an effort to predict what 
will happen on Earth. <a href="../gen/1.html#14">1:14</a>

<p><li>God makes two lights: "the greater light [the sun] to rule the day, and the lesser light [the moon] to rule the night." But
the moon is not a light, but only reflects light from the sun. And why, if God made the moon to "rule the night", does it spend
half of its time moving through the daytime sky? <a href="../gen/1.html#16">1:16</a>

<p><li> &quot;He made the stars also.&quot; God spends a day making light (before making the stars) and separating light 
from darkness; then, at the end of a hard day's work, and almost as an afterthought, he makes
the trillions of stars. <a href="../gen/1.html#16">1:16</a>

<p><li>"And God set them [the stars] in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the 
earth." <a href="../gen/1.html#17">1:17</a>

<p><li>In verse 11, God "let the earth bring forth" the plants. Now he has the earth "bring forth" the animals as well. So maybe 
the creationists have it all wrong. Maybe God created livings things through the process of evolution. 
<a href="../gen/1.html#24">1:24</a>

<p><li>God gave humans dominion over every other living thing on earth. <a href="../gen/1.html#26">1:26</a>

<p><li>God commands us to "be fruitful and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have
     dominion over ... every living thing that moveth upon the earth.&quot; <a href="../gen/1.html#28">1:28</a>

<p><li>"I have given you every herb ... and every tree ... for meat."<br>
Since many plants have evolved poisons to protect against animals that would like to eat them, God's advice is more than a little reckless. 
Would you tell your children to go out in the garden and eat whatever plants they encounter? Of course not. But then, you are much nicer 
and smarter than God.   <a href="../gen/1.html#29">1:29</a>
     
<p><li>All animals were originally herbivores. Tapeworms, vampire bats, 
mosquitoes, and barracudas -- all were strict vegetarians, as they were created 
by God. <a href="../gen/1.html#30">1:30</a>

<p><li>"God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good." He purposefully designed a system 
that ensures the suffering and death of all his creatures, parasite and host, predator and prey. <a href="../gen/1.html#31">1:31</a>

<p><li>In Genesis 1 the entire creation takes 6 days, but the
universe is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_universe">13.7 billion</a> years old, with new stars constantly being formed. <a href="../gen/1.html#31">1:31</a>

<p><li>Humans were not created instantaneously from dust and breath, but
evolved over millions of years from simpler life forms. <a href="../gen/2.html#7">2:7</a>

<p><li>After making the animals, God has
Adam name them all. The naming of several million species must have kept Adam busy for a
while.  <a href="../gen/2.html#18">2:18-22</a>

 <p><li>God fashions a woman out of one of Adam's ribs. <br>
Because of this story, it was commonly believed (and sometimes it is still said today) that males have one less 
rib than females. When Vesalius showed in 1543 that the number of ribs was the same in males and females, it created a storm 
of controversy. <a href="../gen/2.html#19">2:19</a>

<p><li>God curses the serpent. From now on the serpent will crawl on his belly and eat dust.
One wonders how he got around before -- by hopping on his tail, perhaps? But snakes don't
eat dust, do they?  <a href="../gen/3.html#14">3:14</a>

<p><li>Because Adam listened to Eve, God cursed the ground and causes thorns and thistles to grow. Before this,
according to the (false) Genesis story, plants had no natural defenses. The rose had no thorn, cacti were spineless, holly
leaves were smooth, and the nettle had no sting. Foxgloves, oleander, and 
milkweeds were all perfectly safe to eat. <a href="../gen/3.html#17">3:17-18</a>

<p><li>Seth lived 912 years. <a href="../gen/5.html#8">5:8</a>

<p><li>Enos lived 905 years. <a href="../gen/5.html#11">5:11</a>

<p><li>Cainan lived 910 years. <a href="../gen/5.html#14">5:14</a>

<p><li>Mahalaleel lived 895 years. <a href="../gen/5.html#17">5:17</a>

<p><li>Jared lived 962 years. <a href="../gen/5.html#20">5:20</a>

<p><li>Enoch doesn't die he just ascends into heaven. <a href="../gen/5.html#21">5:21-24</a>

<p><li>Enoch lived 365 years before he was taken (alive?) by God.
 <a href="../gen/5.html#23">5:23</a>

<p><li>When Lamech was born, nine generations were alive at once. Adam, Seth, Enos, Cainan, Mahalaleel, Jared, Enoch, Methuselah, and Lamech were all alive at 
the time of Lamech's birth. Adam lived to see his great-great-great-great-great-great-grandson. <a href="../gen/5.html#25">5:25</a>

<p><li>Methuselah lived 969 years. (World record holder.) <a href="../gen/5.html#27">5:27</a>

<p><li> Lamech lived 777 years. <a href="../gen/5.html#31">5:31</a>

<p><li>"There were giants in the earth in those days." <a href="../gen/6.html#4">6:4</a>
 
<p><li>God tells Noah to make one small window (18 inches square) in the 450 
  foot ark for ventilation.  <a href="../gen/6.html#16">6:14-16</a>

<p><li>Whether by twos or by sevens, Noah takes male and female representatives from each
species of "every thing that creepeth upon the earth." <a href="../gen/7.html#8">7:8</a>

<p><li>God opens the "windows of heaven." He does this every time it rains. 
  <a href="../gen/7.html#11">7:11</a>
  
<p><li>All of the animals boarded the ark "in the selfsame day."  <a href="../gen/7.html#13">7:13-14</a>

<p><li>The flood covered the highest mountain tops (Mount Everest?) with fifteen cubits to
spare.  <a href="../gen/7.html#20">7:20</a>

<p><li>"The windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from  heaven was restrained." This 
happens whenever it stops raining. <a href="../gen/8.html#2">8:2</a>

<p><li>Noah sends a dove out to see if there was any dry land. But the dove returns without
finding any. Then, just seven days later, the dove goes out again and returns with an olive leaf.
But how could an olive tree survive the flood? And if any seeds happened to survive, they
certainly wouldn't germinate and grow leaves within a seven day period. 
 <a href="../gen/8.html#8">8:8-11</a>
 
<p><li>When the animals left the ark, what would they have eaten? There would have been no
plants after the ground had been submerged for nearly a year. What would the carnivores have
eaten? Whatever prey they ate would have gone extinct. And how did the New World
primates or the Australian marsupials find their way back after the flood 
subsided? <a href="../gen/8.html#19">8:19</a>

<p><li>"And the Lord smelled a sweet savor."<br>
Noah kills the "clean beasts" and burns their dead bodies for God. According to 
<a href="../gen/7.html#8">7:8</a> this would have caused the extinction of all "clean" animals since only two of each were 
taken onto the ark.  <a href="../gen/8.html#20">8:20-21</a>

<p><li>"Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth." Although this would have been good advice for the mythical Noah, it 
is deadly advice for humankind as a whole. Overpopulation is one of our greatest problems, yet there is nothing in the bible to address it. 
<a href="../gen/9.html#1">9:1</a> 

<p><li>According to this verse, all animals fear humans. Although it is true that many do, it is also 
true that some do not. Sharks and grizzly bears, for example, are generally much 
less afraid of us than we are of them. <a href="../gen/9.html#2">9:2</a>

<p><li>"Into your hand are they (the animals) delivered." God gave the animals to humans, and they can do whatever 
they please with them. This verse has been used by bible believers to justify all kinds of cruelty to 
animals and environmental destruction. <a href="../gen/9.html#2">9:2</a>

<p><li>"I do set my bow in the cloud."<br>
God is rightly filled with remorse for having
killed his creatures. He makes a deal with the animals, promising never to drown 
them all again. He even puts the rainbow in the sky so that whenever he sees it, 
it will remind him of his promise so that he won&#39;t be tempted to do it again. 
(Every time God sees the rainbow he says to himself: &quot;Oh, yeah.... That&#39;s right. 
I promised not to drown the animals again. I guess I&#39;ll have to find something 
else to do.&quot;).  
<br>But rainbows are caused by the nature of light, the refractive index of water, and the shape of raindrops. There were rainbows 
billions of years before humans existed. <a href="../gen/9.html#9">9:13</a>

<p><li>"Peleg; for in his days was the earth divided." <br>
Some creationists believe that this verse refers to continental drift, which, they say,
began to occur during the days of Pelag (which means "division"), about 100 or so years after the flood. But many 
other creationists <a href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/peleg.html">disagree</a>. <a href="../gen/10.html#25">10:25</a>

<p><li>&quot;The whole earth was of one language.&quot; But this could not be true, since by this time (around 2400 BCE) 
there were already many languages, each unintelligible to the others. <a href="../gen/11.html#1">11:1</a>, <a href="../gen/11.html#6">6</a>

<p><li>"Now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do."<br>
God worries that the people will succeed in building a tower high enough to reach him (them?) in heaven, and that by 
so doing they will become omnipotent. <a href="../gen/11.html#4">11:4-6</a>

<p><li>According to the Tower of Babel story, the many human languages were created
instantaneously by God. But actually the various languages evolved gradually over long periods of
time. <a href="../gen/11.html#9">11:9</a>

<p><li>The ridiculously long lives of the patriarchs. <a href="../gen/11.html#10">11:10-32</a>

<p><li> Shem lived 600 years. <a href="../gen/11.html#12">11:12-13</a>

<p><li>Salah lived 433 years. <a href="../gen/11.html#14">11:14-15</a>

<p><li>Eber lived 464 years. <a href="../gen/11.html#16">11:16-17</a>

<p><li>Peleg lived 239 years. <a href="../gen/11.html#18">11:18-19</a>

<p><li>Reu lived 239 years. <a href="../gen/11.html#20">11:20-21</a>

<p><li>Serug lived 229 years. <a href="../gen/11.html#22">11:22-23</a>

<p><li>Nahor lived 148 years.  <a href="../gen/11.html#24">11:24-25</a>

<p><li>And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years. <a href="../gen/11.html#32">11:32</a>

<p><li>"Abram ... pursued them unto Dan."<br>
This is an obvious anachronism, since the city of Dan was not named "Dan" until the time of the Judges 
(see <a href="../jg/18.html#29">Judges 18:29</a>). In fact, Dan (for whom the city 
was named) was not even born yet (see <a href="../gen/30.html#6">Genesis 30:6</a>). <a href="../gen/14.html#14">14:14</a>

<p><li> "And they returned to the land of the Philistines." 
But the Philistines didn't arrive in the region of Canaan until around 1200 BCE -- 
800 years after Abraham's supposed migration from Ur. <a href="../gen/21.html#32">21:32</a>, 
<a href="../gen/26.html#1">26:1</a>

<p><li>God sends quails to feed his people until they were "two cubits [about a meter] high upon the face of the earth." Taking
the "face of the earth" to be a circle with a radius of say 30 kilometers (an approximate day's journey), this would amount to 3
trillion (3x10<sup>12</sup>) liters of quails. At 2 quails per liter, this would provide a couple million quails for each of several million
people.

<p><li>&quot;And there we saw the giants
... And we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their
sight.&quot; This statement may have been figurative, hyperbole, typical biblical 
exaggeration, or an actual description of the sons of Anak, in which case they must have been
about 100 meters tall.  These are the same giants (the Nephilium) that resulted 
when the &quot;sons of God&quot; mated with &quot;the daughters of men in

The earth rests upon pillars and doesn't move (unless God gets angry or something). <a href="../job/9.html#6">9:6</a>

The earth is fixed and the sun travels about it. <a href="../job/9.html#7">9:7</a>

<p><li>The earth is set on foundations and it does not move. <a href="../job/38.html#4">38:4-6</a>

God seems pleased to have created prey for lions and ravens to eat. <a href="../job/38.html#39">38:39-41</a>

<p><li>"Will the unicorn be willing to serve thee?" The unicorn referred to here is probably not the single-horned mythical creature, but rather 
a wild ox that was mistranslated in the KJV. <a href="../job/39.html#9">39:9-10</a>

<p><li> Ostriches are not cruel and stupid birds who abandon their eggs to die after laying them, as these verses 
imply. They are, in fact, careful and attentive parents. The male scoops out a hollow for the eggs, 
which are incubated by the female during the day and the male at night. After the eggs are hatched, 
they are cared for by the mother for over a month, at which time the chicks can keep up with running 
adults. <a href="../job/39.html#13">39:13-16</a>

<p><li>"The eagle ... seeketh the prey.... Her young ones suck up blood."<br>
  God is pleased with the way that predators kill and devour their prey. <a href="../job/39.html#27">39:27-30</a>

<p><li>Bible believers have identified the behemoth as a hippopotamus, dinosaur, wildebeest, or 
crocodile. But my favorite is the way these verses are

by Stephen Mitchell</a>: &quot;Look now: the Beast that I 
made: he eats grass like a bull. Look: the power in his thighs, the pulsing 
sinews of his belly. His penis stiffens like a pine; his testicles bulge with 
vigor.&quot; <a href="../job/40.html#15">40:15-16</a>

<p><li>"Canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook? or his tongue with a cord?" <a href="../job/41.html#1">41:1</a>

<a href="../ps/74.html#13">74:13-14</a>

<p><li>"Thou has set all the borders of the earth"<br>
A spherical earth has no borders. <a href="../ps/74.html#17">74:17</a>

<p><li>God holds the earth up with pillars.  <a href="../ps/75.html#3">75:3</a>

    See <a href="../num/11.html#20">Numbers 11:20-32</a>, where God sends quails to feed the Israelites until it literally came out their 
    noses. <a href="../ps/78.html#27">78:27</a>

unnecessary. <a href="../ps/103.html#2">103:2-3</a>

(The earth is stationary and does not orbit the sun.) <a href="../ps/104.html#5">104:5</a>

Noah's flood covered the highest mountains, just like it says in <a href="../gen/7.html#20">Genesis 7:20</a>.   <a href="../ps/105.html#6">104:6-7</a>

<p><li>God gives the lions their meat. The cruelty and brutality of nature are all part of God's plan. 
 <a href="../ps/104.html#21">104:21</a>

<p><li>"In wisdom hast thou made them all." (God purposely designed the brutality and cruelty of nature.) 
<a href="../ps/104.html#24">104:24</a>

<p><li>"The LORD is good to all: and his tender mercies are over all his works." Then why do nearly 
all animals die painful deaths from starvation, predation, or disease long before they reach adulthood? 
<a href="../ps/145.html#9">145:9</a>

<p><li>God "satisfiest the desire of every living thing." But in nature few needs are met

<p><li>"The sun also ariseth"<br>
Although this verse is interpreted figuratively today, it was taken literally by virtually all

teaching the heliocentric heresy. <a href="../ec/1.html#5">1:5</a>

<p><li>"The place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again."<br>
Good description of the water cycle. <a href="../ec/1.html#7">1:7</a></li></p>

<p><li>"He hath made every thing beautiful."<br>
Everything is beautiful in its own way. Parasitic worms, cancer cells, bubonic plague. You just have to look at it from God's eyes.
<a href="../ec/3.html#11">3:11</a>

<p><li>"No man can find out the work that God maketh."<br>
Science is impossible. We can learn nothing at all about the natural world. <a href="../ec/3.html#11">3:11</a>

<p><li>"That which is far off, and exceeding deep, who can find it out?"<br>
    Who can find out? We can by using science! The earth, ocean, solar system, galaxy, and universe -- nothing is too deep or far away for 
    science to discover and explore. <a href="../ec/7.html#24">7:24</a>

<p><li>"Then I beheld all the work of God, that a man cannot find out the work
    that is done under the sun: because though a man labour to seek it out, yet
    he shall not find it; yea farther; though a wise man think to know it, yet
    shall he not be able to find it."<br>
    Oh, I think science has done a pretty good job of finding things out over the last four centuries or so. <a href="../ec/8.html#16">8:16</a>

<p><li>"Thou knowest not ... how the bones do grow in the womb of her that is with child."<br>

In the Bible, people think with their hearts not their heads. <a href="../is/10.html#7">10:7</a>

<p><li>"The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb...." I wonder what will become of the spiders. 
Will they be more friendly toward flies? And will the parasitic wasps find another way to feed their larvae? Or will they 
continue to feed off the living bodies of caterpillars?  <a href="../is/11.html#6">11:6</a>, 
<a href="../is/65.html#25">65:25</a>

<p><li>&quot;And&nbsp; the weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice' den.&quot; A cockatrice 
is a serpent, hatched from a cock's egg, that can kill with a glance. They are rare nowadays.&nbsp; 
<a href="../is/11.html#8">11:8</a>

<p><li>God will gather up the people of Judea "from the four corners of the earth." In the Bible's view, the earth is flat with four
corners.  <a href="../is/11.html#12">11:12</a>

<p><li>The moon produces its own light and the earth does not move (except
when God gets angry and shakes the heavens). <a href="../is/13.html#10">13:10-13</a>

<p><li>When God gets really angry, he causes earthquakes.  <a href="../is/13.html#13">13:13</a>

<p><li>Dragons will live in Babylonian palaces and satyrs will dance there.  
<a href="../is/13.html#21">13:21-22</a>

<p><li>Out of the serpent's root shall come forth a cockatrice, and his fruit shall be a fiery flying serpent." What ever happened

<p><li> "The foundations of the earth do shake ... The earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard."<br>
(Earthquakes are all a part of God's wondrous plan.) <a href="../is/24.html#18">24:18-20</a>

<a href="../is/27.html#1">27:1</a>

<p><li>"The light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be
     sevenfold." Well, this is one prophecy that will never come true. Since the moon has no light of its own, but only 
     reflects that of the sun, it could never shine like the sun. And the sun will not, at least not while there are humans to see 
     it, shine 7 times as bright as it does now.  <a href="../is/30.html#26">30:26</a>
     
<p><li>"The LORD shall cause his glorious voice to be heard, and shall shew

<p><li>God makes the sun move backwards 10 degrees. Now that's a neat trick!  <a href="../is/38.html#8">38:8</a>

<p><li> The earth is a flat disc that God looks down upon from his throne in 
heaven.  <a href="../is/40.html#22">40:22</a>

<p><li>God cut <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahab_%28demon%29">Rahab</a> (the sea 
monster) to pieces, wounded the dragon, and dried up the sea. <a href="../is/51.html#9">51:9-10</a>
<p><li>Bad people hatch poisonous cockatrice eggs. Whoever eats the eggs will die, and 
when the eggs are crushed a viper hatches out of them. <a href="../is/59.html#5">59:5</a>

and the male at night. After the eggs are hatched, they are 
cared for by the mother for over a month, at which time the chicks can keep up with running adults. <a href="../lam/4.html#3">4:3</a>

<p><li> The third year of the reign of Jehoiakim would be 606 BCE, at which time Nebuchadnezzar was not yet king of Babylon. It was 597 BCE that Nebuchadnezzar invaded Jerusalem for the first time (without actually
destroying it). By that time Jehohiakim was dead and his son, Jehoiachin, was 
ruling. <a href="../dan/1.html#1">1:1</a>

<p><li>The stone became &quot;a great mountain&quot; that &quot;filled the whole earth.&quot; This could only be possible on a flat, disc-shaped earth.
  <a href="../dan/2.html#35">2:35</a>

<p><li>"Belshazzar the king"<br>
Apparently, the author of Daniel knew of only two Babylonian kings during the period of the 
exile: Nebuchadnezzar and Belshazzar, who he wrongly thought was the son of Nebuchadnezzar. But
Nebuchadnezzar died in 562 BCE and was succeeded by his son, Awil-Marduk (referred to in the bible 
as &quot;Evilmerodach&quot; [see <A href="../2kg/25.html#27">2 Kg 25:27</A> and 
<A href="../jer/52.html#31">Jer 52:31</A>]).  In 560 BCE, Amel-Marduk was 
assassinated by his brother-in-law, Nergal-shar-usur.  The next and last king of Babylon was 
Nabonidus who reigned from 556 to 539, when Babylon was conquered by Cyrus. It was Nabonidus, and not 
Belshazzar, who was the last of the Babylonian kings. Belshazzar was a the son and viceroy of 
Nabonidus. But he was not a king, and was not the son (or any other relation) of 
Nebuchadnezzar. <a href="../dan/5.html#2">5:1-2,11,18,22</a>

<p><li> Darius the Median is a fictitious character whom the author perhaps confused with 
Darius I of Persia, who came to the throne in 521 BCE, 17 years after the fall of Babylon. The author of Daniel 
incorrectly makes him the successor of Belshazzar instead of Cyrus. <a href="../dan/5.html#31">5:31</a>

<p><li>To Daniel, the stars are small objects that can fall from the sky and then be "stamped upon." <a href="../dan/8.html#10">8:10</a>

If the star "went before them," leading them to Bethlehem, then it couldn't have been a star or any 
other astronomical object or event. But Matthew couldn't have known that. Everyone at the time 
thought that stars were just little points of light a short distance above the earth. It'd be no 
problem to have one hover above a particular place for a while. <a href="../mt/2.html#9">2:9</a>

<p><li> Herod kills all boys in and around Bethlehem that are two years old and under. Such a massacre would certainly have

<p><li>"Behold the fowls of the air...." Jesus says that God feeds them. But, if so, he does one hell of a lousy job at it. Most
birds die before leaving the nest, and the few who manage to fly soon die painful deaths of starvation, predation, or disease.
If God is caring for them, pray that he stays away from you.  <a href="../mt/6.html#26">6:26</a>

<p><li>Speaking of the birds, Jesus asks: "Are ye not much better than they?" This is meant as a rhetorical

what? That weather is sent by God and can be controlled by faith? <a href="../mt/8.html#24">8:24-26</a>

<p><li>Jesus heals a "dumb man possessed by a devil." (Those who cannot speak are possessed by a devil.) <a href="../mt/9.html#32">9:32-33</a>

<p><li>"Jesus went about all the cities and villages ... healing every sickness and every disease." <a href="../mt/9.html#35">9:35</a>

 <p><li>Jesus tells his disciples to perform all the usual tricks: "heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, 
raise the dead, and cast out devils."  <a href="../mt/10.html#8">10:8</a>

<p><li>Jesus heals a withered hand. <a href="../mt/12.html#10">12:10-13</a>

<p><li>"Great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all." <a href="../mt/12.html#15">12:15</a>

<p><li>God is involved in the death of every sparrow. He sees to it that they each die 
painful deaths of starvation, predation, or disease. But don't worry. God will do the same for you. (He thinks that humans 
are worth much more than sparrows.) <a href="../mt/10.html#29">10:29. 31</a>

<p><li>Jesus casts out a devil from a man who was
blind and dumb. (Those who are unable to see or hear are possessed by devils.)  <a href="../mt/12.html#22">12:22</a>

<p><li>"Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly."<br>

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0830815503/skepticsannotate">Some Christians</a> believe that the natural 
    evil in the world (predators, parasites, pain, death) is due to Satan, not God. <a href="../mt/13.html#28">13:28</a>
 
<p><li>Jesus is incorrect when he says that the mustard seed is the smallest seed. And since there are no trees in the
mustard family, mustard seeds do not grow into "the greatest of all trees."  <a href="../mt/13.html#31">13:31-32</a>

<p><li>"Jesus ... saw a great multitude ... and he healed their sick." <a href="../mt/14.html#14">14:14</a>

<p><li>"They sent out into all that country round about, and brought unto him all that were diseased ... and as
    many as touched were made perfectly whole." <a href="../mt/14.html#35">14:35-37</a>

<p><li>Jesus cures an epileptic "lunatic" by "rebuking the devil." (Epilepsy is caused by devils.) 
 <a href="../mt/17.html#15">17:15-18</a>
 
 <p><li>"The blind and the lame came to him in the temple; and he healed them." <a href="../mt/21.html#14">21:14</a>
 
<p><li>The end of the world will be signaled by wars, famines, disease, and earthquakes (6-7). And that's just 
    "the beginning of sorrows" (8). Next believers will be hated and killed by unbelievers (9), believers will hate and betray each other (10), false 
    prophets will fool people (11), iniquity will abound and love wax cold (12). But hey, if you make through all that, you'll be saved (13).  
    
    <p>Only one more thing will happen before the end comes: the gospel will be preached throughout the world (14). Well, that and the abomination 
    of desolations will stand in the holy place (15), many false Christs and false prophets will show great signs and wonders (24), the sun and moon 
    will be darkened and the stars will fall (29), the sign of the son of Man will appear in the sky, everyone on earth will mourn, and then, 
    finally, the great and powerful son of Man will come in all his glory (30).
    
    <p>Oh, and all these things will happen within the lifespan of Jesus' contemporaries (34).
    
    <p>Or maybe not. Jesus was talking about things he knew nothing about (36). (See <a href="../mk/13.html#32">Mark 13:32</a>.)
  <a href="../mt/24.html#3">24:3-51</a>

<p><li>"The moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven." Apparently, Jesus believed that the moon
produces its own light, and that the stars are lights held in place by a firmament only a few miles above our heads. 
 <a href="../mt/24.html#29">24:29</a>
 
<p><li>Jesus believed that Noah's flood actually happened. <a href="../mt/24.html#37">24:37</a>

<p><li>When Jesus was crucified, there was three hours of complete darkness "over all the land." And when he 
died, there was a great earthquake with many corpses walking the streets of Jerusalem. It is strange 
that there is no record of any of these extraordinary events outside of the gospels. 
 <a href="../mt/27.html#45">27:45, 51-53</a>
 
 <p><li>"And behold, there was a great earthquake." <a href="../mt/28.html#2">28:2</a>

<p><li>Jesus heals "all that were diseased" by casting out devils. <a href="../mk/1.html#32">1:32-34</a>

<p><li>Jesus heals a paralytic man by forgiving his sins. (Paralysis is caused by sinful behavior.) Notice that Jesus didn't just heal him, 
he forgave his sins, which is something only God is supposed to be able to do. <a href="../mk/2.html#3">2:3-12</a>

<p><li>Jesus heals a man with a "withered hand." <a href="../mk/3.html#1">3:1-5</a>

<p><li>"He [Jesus] ordained twelve, that they should ... have power to heal sicknesses, 
    and to cast out devils."  <a href="../mk/3.html#14">3:14-15</a>

<p><li>Jesus is incorrect when he says that the mustard seed is the smallest seed.  
(The <a href="http://waynesword.palomar.edu/plfeb96.htm">smallest seeds</a> are found among 
the tropical, epiphytic orchids.) <a href="../mk/4.html#31">4:31</a>

<a href="../mk/4.html#39">4:39</a>

<p><li>"A certain woman ... had an issue of blood twelve years...."<br>
So this is where all those phony faith-healing stories came from! Notice that the doctors made her condition worse, but she was instantly cured 
by faith. <a href="../mk/5.html#25">5:25-29</a>

 <p><li>"Thy faith hath made thee whole." If you have enough faith, you will never get sick. 
 (Illness is caused by sin and lack of faith. Medical science is unnecessary.) <a href="../mk/5.html#34">5:34</a>

<p><li>"And they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed them." 
<a href="../mk/6.html#13">6:13</a>

<p><li>Jesus walks on water and calms the sea. <a href="../mk/6.html#48">6:48-51</a>    

<p><li>"Whithersoever he entered, into villages, or cities, or country, they laid the sick in the streets, and besought him that 
they might touch if it were but the border of his garment: and as many as touched him were made whole."  <a href="../mk/6.html#56">6:56</a> 

<p><li>Jesus puts his fingers in a deaf man's ears, then spits and touches his tongue. This immediately cured his deafness. 
<a href="../mk/7.html#32">7:32-35</a>

<p><li>Jesus cures a blind man by spitting in his eyes. <a href="../mk/8.html#22">8:22-23</a>

<p><li>Jesus' spit did not completely cure the blind. So Jesus tried again. He put his hands on the man's 
eyes and, this time, the blind man "saw every man clearly." <a href="../mk/8.html#24">8:24-25</a>
 
<p><li>Jesus heals a boy with "a dumb spirit" by saying, "Thou dumb and deaf spirit, I charge 
thee, come out of him and enter no more into him." (Sounds like a script from Monty Python, 
doesn't it?) But how could a deaf spirit hear the words
spoken to it? And how could a dumb spirit cry out?  <a href="../mk/9.html#17">9:17, 25-26</a>

<p><li>Immortal worms: "Where their worm dieth not" <a href="../mk/9.html#44">9:44, 46, 48</a>

<p><li>"But from the beginning of the creation God made them male and female."<br>
 Jesus believed that sex and Adam and Eve were created
"from the beginning." But the universe is about 13.7 billion years old,
the earth 4.6 billion, sex a billion years or so, and humans (depending
on how you define "human") for a couple million years. <a href="../mk/10.html#6">10:6</a>

<p><li>"Jesus said unto him, Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee whole. And
    immediately he received his sight." <a href="../mk/10.html#52">10:52</a>

<p><li>"The beginnings of sorrows."<br>
The end of the world will be marked with wars, famines, and earthquakes. (Thank God for <i>that</i> helpful hint!) <a href="../mk/13.html#8">13:8</a>
    
<p><li>&quot;In those days ... the moon shall not give her light, and 
the stars of heaven shall fall.&quot; Of course this is nonsense. The billions of stars will never 
fall to earth and the moon does not produce its own light. <a href="../mk/13.html#24">13:24-25</a>

<p><li>"If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye

"sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee."  <a href="../jn/5.html#14">5:14</a>

<p><li>The disciples ask Jesus about the cause of a man's blindness. Was it because he or his parents sinned? Jesus said neither 
    had sinned. The man was born blind so that Jesus could show off his powers by curing him of his blindness.   
     <a href="../jn/9.html#1">9:1-3</a>
     
<p><li>Jesus spits on the ground, mixes his spit with the dirt, and rubs the muddy spit on (or in?) a blind man's eyes. 
Then he told him to wash in the pool of Siloam. After that, the blind man could see again. 
The Bible doesn't say whether it was the holy spit, holy mud, or holy water that did the trick. <a href="../jn/9.html#6">9:6-7</a>

<p><li>"Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit."<br>
Jesus was wrong about seeds. If a seed dies, it dies. It only produces a new plant if it stays alive (in a dormant stage) until 
it germinates. Dead seeds bring forth no fruit. <a href="../jn/12.html#24">12:24</a>

<p><li><i>"In Adam all die."</i><br>
Nothing died before Adam sinned. <a href="../1cor/15.html#22">15:22</a>

<p><li>Paul shows his ignorance (and God's) of biology by saying that only dead seeds will germinate. Actually, a seed
must be alive to germinate. <a href="../1cor/15.html#36">15:36</a>

 <p><li>"All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one kind of flesh of men, another of beasts."<br>
    This verse is used by Creationists to argue against both evolution and any attempt to create "human-animal hybrids" or 
    "chimeras." <a href="../1cor/15.html#39">15:39</a>

<p><li>"The first man Adam"<br>
Young Earth Creationists use this verse to support 
a literal reading of Genesis. "If we cannot believe in the First Adam, why believe in the Last [Christ]?"
 <a href="../1cor/15.html#45">15:45</a>
 
 <p><li>"And afterward that which is spiritual."<br>
Asa Gray, the foremost American botanist in the 19th century and close friend of Charles Darwin, 
used this verse to support the idea that the Bible is not inconsistent with human evolution.

<p><li>"Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him." This could only happen on a 
flat earth. <a href="../rev/1.html#7">1:7</a>

<p><li>"Thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created." God created parasites, 
pathogens, and predators for his very own pleasure. One of his favorite species is 
<a href="http://dwindlinginunbelief.blogspot.com/2006/06/gods-fiery-serpents.html">guinea worms</a>. <a href="../rev/4.html#11">4:11</a>

<p><li>The sixth seal is opened and there is a great earthquake, the sun becomes black, and the moon red, 
the stars fall from heaven, and mountains and islands move around. <a href="../rev/6.html#12">6:12-14</a>

<p><li>"And the stars of heaven fell unto the earth...." To John, the stars are just little lights a few miles away that can
easily fall to the earth.  <a href="../rev/6.html#13">6:13</a>

<p><li>John "saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth." Well, I guess that settles it: the earth is flat and
square-shaped, or at least quadrilateral in shape. <a href="../rev/7.html#1">7:1</a>

<p><li>An angel threw the censer down to earth, causing thunder, lightning, and earthquakes.
<a href="../rev/8.html#5">8:5</a>

<p><li>"And there fell a great star from heaven, burning as it were a lamp, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers,
and upon the fountains of waters." In the Bible, stars are just little lights that can fall to the 
ground from the sky.  <a href="../rev/8.html#10">8:10</a>

<p><li>The fourth trumpet smites one third of the sun, moon, and stars. <a href="../rev/8.html#12">8:12</a>

<p><li>"I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth." <a href="../rev/9.html#1">9:1</a>

<p><li>"There were lightnings, and voices, and thunderings, and an earthquake, and great hail." <a href="../rev/11.html#19">11:19</a>

<p><li> The dragon's tail smacks down to earth one third of the stars. To the author of Revelation,
the stars are just little lights that can fall to the ground from the sky. <a href="../rev/12.html#4">12:4</a>

<p><li>The seventh vial: voices, thunders, lightnings, earthquakes, hail. <a href="../rev/16.html#17">16:17-21</a>

<p><li>"And there was no more sea."<br>
For an old sailor like me, this verse, if it were true, would 
be one of the saddest verses in the Bible.  <a href="../rev/21.html#1">21:1</a>
