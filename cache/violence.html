<p><b><a href="../gen/cr_list.html">Genesis</a></b>
<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../gen/cr.html" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p><li>Because God liked Abel's animal sacrifice more than Cain's vegetables, Cain kills his brother 
Abel in a fit of religious jealousy. <a href="../gen/4.html#8">4:8</a>

<p><li><i>"I will destroy ... both man and beast."</i><br>
God is angry. He decides to destroy all humans, beasts, creeping things, fowls, and "all
flesh wherein there is breath of life." He plans to drown them all. 
 <a href="../gen/6.html#7">6:7</a>, <a href="../gen/6.html#17">17</a>
 
 <p><li><i>"Every living substance that I have made will I destroy."</i><br>
 God repeats his intention to kill "every living substance ... from off the face of the earth."
But why does God kill all the innocent animals? What had they done to deserve his wrath? It
seems God never gets his fill of tormenting animals. <a href="../gen/7.html#4">7:4</a>

<p><li><i>"All flesh died that moved upon the earth."</i><br>
God drowns everything that breathes air. From newborn babies to koala bears -- all
creatures great and small, the Lord God drowned them all. <a href="../gen/7.html#21">7:21-23</a>

<p><li>God sends a plague on the Pharaoh and his household because the Pharaoh believed
Abram's lie. <a href="../gen/12.html#17">12:17</a>

<p><li>God tells Abram to kill some animals for him. The needless slaughter makes God feel 
better. <a href="../gen/15.html#9">15:9-10</a>

<p><li>Hagar conceives, making Sarai jealous. Abram tells Sarai to do to Hagar whatever she
wants. "And when Sarai dealt hardly with her, she fled." <a href="../gen/16.html#6">16:6</a>

<p><li>"I will not destroy it for ten's sake."<br>
    I guess God couldn't find even ten good Sodomites because he decides to kill them all in <a href="../gen/19.html#1">Genesis 19</a>. 
    Too bad Abraham didn't ask God about the children. Why not save them? If Abraham could find 10 good children, toddlers, infants, or babies, would 
    God spare the city? Apparently not. God doesn't give a damn about children. <a href="../gen/18.html#32">18:32</a>


<p><li>Lot refuses to give up his angels to the perverted mob, offering his two "virgin daughters"
instead. He tells the bunch of angel rapers to "do unto them [his daughters] as is good in your
eyes." This is the same man that is called "just" and "righteous" in 
<a href="../2pet/2.html#7">2 Peter 2:7-8</a>. <a href="../gen/19.html#7">19:7-8</a>

<p><li>God kills everyone (men, women, children, infants, newborns) in Sodom and Gomorrah
by raining "fire and brimstone from the Lord out of heaven." Well, almost everyone -- he
spares the "just and righteous" Lot and his family. <a href="../gen/19.html#24">19:24</a>

<p><li>Lot's nameless wife looks back, and God turns her into a pillar of salt. 
<a href="../gen/19.html#26">19:26</a>

<p><li>God gets angry with king Abimelech, though the king hasn't even touched Sarah. He
says to the king, "Behold, thou art but a dead man," and threatens to kill him and all of his
people. To compensate for the crime he never committed, Abimelech gives Abraham sheep,
oxen, slaves, silver, and land. Finally, after Abraham "prayed unto God," God lifts his
punishment to Abimelech, "for the Lord had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of
Abimelech, because of Sarah." <a href="../gen/20.html#3">20:3-18</a>

<p><li>Sarah, after giving birth to Isaac, gets angry again at Hagar (see 
<a href="../gen/16.html#5">16:5-6</a>) and tells Abraham to 'cast out this bondwoman and her son." God commands Abraham to
"hearken unto her voice." So Abraham abandons Hagar and Ishmael, casting them out into the
wilderness to die. <a href="../gen/21.html#10">21:10-14</a>

<p><li>God orders Abraham to kill Isaac as a burnt offering. Abraham shows his love for
God by his willingness to murder his son. But finally, just before Isaac's throat is slit, God
provides a goat to kill instead. <a href="../gen/22.html#2">22:2-13</a>

<p><li>Abraham shows his willingness to kill his son for God. Only an evil God would ask a father to do that; only a bad 
father would be willing to do it. <a href="../gen/22.html#10">22:10</a>

<p><li>"Because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son."<br> Why did God love Abraham so much? 
Because he was willing to murder his son for him. (Greater evil hath no man than this, that he is willing to kill his own son for God.) 
<a href="../gen/22.html#16">22:16</a>

<p><li>Dinah, the daughter of Jacob, is "defiled" by a man who seems to love her dearly. Her
brothers trick all of the men of the town and kill them (after first having them all circumcised),
and then take their wives and children captive. <a href="../gen/34.html#1">34:1-31</a>

<p><li>"The terror of God was upon the cities that were round about them." <a href="../gen/35.html#5">35:5</a>

<p><li>"And Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the Lord; and the Lord slew him."
What did Er do to elicit God's wrath? The Bible doesn't say. Maybe he picked up 
some sticks on Saturday. <a href="../gen/38.html#7">38:7</a>

<p><li>After God killed Er, Judah tells Onan to "go in unto they brother's wife." But "Onan
knew that the seed should not be his; and ... when he went in unto his brother's wife ... he
spilled it on the ground.... And the thing which he did displeased the Lord; wherefore he slew
him also." This lovely Bible story is seldom read in Sunday School, but it is the basis of many
Christian doctrines, including the condemnation of both masturbation and birth control. 
<a href="../gen/38.html#8">38:8-10</a>

<p><li>After Judah pays Tamar for her services, he is told that she "played the harlot" and "is
with child by whoredom." When Judah hears this, he says, "Bring her forth, and let her be
burnt." <a href="../gen/38.html#24">38:24</a>

<p><li>Joseph interprets the baker's dream. He says that the pharaoh will cut off the baker's
head, and hang his headless body on a tree for the birds to eat. 
<a href="../gen/40.html#19">40:19</a>

<p><li>God brought a seven year, "very grievous" famine on the whole earth for no apparent reason (except maybe to make Joseph wealthy).
 <a href="../gen/41.html#25">41:25-32, 54</a>

<p><li>Moses murders an Egyptian after making sure that no one is looking.  <a href="../ex/2.html#11">2:11-12</a>

<p><li>"I will ... smite Egypt with all my wonders." <a href="../ex/3.html#20">3:20</a>

<p><li>God threatens to kill the Pharaoh's firstborn son.  <a href="../ex/4.html#23">4:23</a>

<p><li>God decides to kill Moses because his son had not yet been circumcised.  
<a href="../ex/4.html#24">4:24-26</a>

<p><li>Moses and Aaron ask the Pharaoh to let all the Israelites go into the desert to pray for three days, or else God 
will kill them all "with pestilence, or with the sword." <a href="../ex/5.html#3">5:3</a>

<p><li>"Now shalt thou see what I will do to Pharaoh." <a href="../ex/6.html#1">6:1</a>

<p><li>God will make sure that Pharaoh does not listen to Moses, so that he can kill Egyptians with his 
armies. <a href="../ex/7.html#4">7:4</a>

<p><li>"And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD." Who else could be so cruel and unjust? 
<a href="../ex/7.html#5">7:5</a>, <a href="../ex/7.html#17">17</a>

<p><li>God tells Moses and Aaron to smite the river and turn it into blood. This is the first of the
famous 10 plagues of Egypt.  <a href="../ex/7.html#17">7:17-24</a>

<p><li>The fifth plague: all cattle in Egypt die.<br> But a 
little later (<A href="../ex/9.html#19">9:19-20</A>, <a href="../ex/12.html#29">12:29</a>), God 
kills them again a couple more times. <a href="../ex/9.html#6">9:6</a>

<p><li>The sixth plague: boils and blains upon man and beast. <a href="../ex/9.html#9">9:9-12</a>

<p><li>"For I will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart, and upon thy servants, and upon thy 
people; that thou mayest know that there is none like me in all the earth." Who else but the biblical 
god could be so cruel? <a href="../ex/9.html#14">9:14</a>

<p><li>God gave power to the Pharaoh so that he could show off his own power by killing him. <a href="../ex/9.html#15">9:15-16</a>

<p><li>The seventh plague is hail. "And the hail smote throughout the land of Egypt all 
that was in the field, both man and beast." <a href="../ex/9.html#22">9:22-25</a>

<p><li>God wants to be remembered forever for the mass murder of little children. <a href="../ex/10.html#2">10:2</a>

<p><li>These verses clearly show that the mass murder of innocent children by God was 
premeditated. (see <a href="../ex/12.html">12:29-30</a>) <a href="../ex/11.html#4">11:4-6</a>

<p><li>God will kill the Egyptian children to show that he puts "a difference between the Egyptians and 
Israel." <a href="../ex/11.html#7">11:7</a>

<p><li>God explains to Moses that he intends to "smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast.  
<a href="../ex/12.html#12">12:12</a>

<p><li>After God has sufficiently hardened the Pharaoh's heart, he kills all the firstborn Egyptian children. When he was finished
"there was not a house where there was not one dead." Finally, he runs out of little babies to kill, so he slaughters the firstborn
cattle, too. <a href="../ex/12.html#29">12:29</a>

<p><li>To commemorate the divine massacre of the Egyptian children, Moses instructs the Israelites to "sacrifice to the
Lord all that openeth the matrix" -- all the males, that is. God has no use for dead, burnt female bodies.  
<a href="../ex/13.html#2">13:2, 12, 15</a>

<p><li>"I will harden Pharaoh's heart." <a href="../ex/14.html#4">14:4</a>

<p><li>After hardening Pharaoh's heart a few more times, God drowns Pharaoh's army in the sea. <a href="../ex/14.html#4">14:4-28</a>

<p><li>The LORD shall fight for you. <a href="../ex/14.html#14">14:14</a>

<p><li>"I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall follow them: and I will get me honour."</i> <a href="../ex/14.html#17">14:17</a>

<p><li>"And the Egyptians shall
    know that I am the LORD, when I have gotten me honour upon Pharaoh, upon his
    chariots, and upon his horsemen." <a href="../ex/14.html#18">14:18</a> 
    
<p><li>"And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the sea, that
    the waters may come again upon the Egyptians." <a href="../ex/14.html#26">14:26</a>
    
<p><li>"And Israel saw that great work which the LORD did upon the Egyptians." <a href="../ex/14.html#31">14:31</a>    

<p><li>Moses and the people sing praises to their murderous god. <a href="../ex/15.html#1">15:1-19</a>

<p><li>"The Lord is a man of war." Indeed, judging from his acts in the Old Testament, he is a vicious warlike monster. 
 <a href="../ex/15.html#3">15:3</a>
 
<p><li>God's right hand dashes people in pieces. <a href="../ex/15.html#6">15:6</a>

<p><li>"For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen
    into the sea, and the LORD brought again the waters of the sea upon them." <a href="../ex/15.html#19">15:19</a>
    
    <p><li>"Horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea." <a href="../ex/15.html#21">15:21</a>

<p><li>If you do what God says, he won't send his diseases on you (like he did to the Egyptians). 
But otherwise.... <a href="../ex/15.html#26">15:26</a>

<p><li>Joshua, with God's approval, kills the Amalekites "with the edge of the sword."  <a href="../ex/17.html#13">17:13</a>

<p><li>"I will utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven." <a href="../ex/17.html#14">17:14</a>

<p><li>"The Lord has sworn [God swears!] that the Lord will have war with Amalek from generation to generation." So God
is still fighting Amalek. I hope Moses can still keep his hand up. <a href="../ex/17.html#14">17:14-16</a>

<p><li>Any person or animal that touches Mt. Sinai shall be stoned to death or "shot through." Did Moses impose such severe
penalties because he feared that someone might see him fake his meeting with God?  
<a href="../ex/19.html#12">19:12-13</a>

<p><li>Like the great and powerful Wizard of Oz, nobody can see God and live. <a href="../ex/19.html#21">19:21</a>

<p><li>God gives instructions for killing and burning animals. He says that if we will make such "burnt offerings," he will bless
us for it. What kind of mind would be pleased by the killing and burning of innocent animals?  <a href="../ex/20.html#24">20:24</a>

<p><li>A child who hits or curses his parents must be executed.  <a href="../ex/21.html#15">21:15, 17</a>

<p><li>It's okay to beat your slaves; even if they die you won't be punished, 
just as long as they survive a day or two after the beating (see verses <a href="../ex/21.html#20" >21:20-21</a>). 
But avoid excessive damage to their eyes or teeth. Otherwise you may have to set them free. <a href="../ex/21.html#26">21:26-27</a>

<p><li>An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. <a href="../ex/21.html#24">21:24-25</a>

<p><li>If an ox gores someone, "then the ox shall surely be stoned."
 <a href="../ex/21.html#28">21:28</a> 
 
<p><li>If an ox gores someone due to the negligence of its owner, 
   then &quot;the ox shall be stoned, and his owner shall be put to death.&quot;.
 <a href="../ex/21.html#29">21:29</a>
  
<p><li>If an ox gores a slave, the owner of the ox must pay the owner of the slave 30 shekels of silver, 
   and "the ox shall be stoned." <a href="../ex/21.html#32">21:32</a>
   
<p><li>"Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live." Thousands of innocent women have suffered excruciating deaths because of this
verse.  <a href="../ex/22.html#18">22:18</a>

<p><li>"Whosoever lieth with a beast shall surely be put to death." Is it really necessary to kill such people? Couldn't we just
send them to counseling or something? <a href="../ex/22.html#19">22:19</a>

<p><li>"He who sacrificeth unto any god, save unto the Lord only, he shall be utterly destroyed." If this commandment is obeyed,
then the four billion people who do not believe in the biblical god must be killed.  <a href="../ex/22.html#20">22:20</a>

<p><li>If you make God angry enough, he will kill you and your family with his own sword.  <a href="../ex/22.html#24">22:24</a>

<p><li>"The firstborn of thy sons thou shalt give unto me." (As a burnt offering?)  <a href="../ex/22.html#29">22:29</a>

<p><li>God promises to "send his fear before the Israelites" and 
to kill everyone that they encounter when they enter the promised land. 
<a href="../ex/23.html#27">23:27</a>

<p><li>God has hornets that bite and kill people.  <a href="../ex/23.html#28">23:28</a>

<p><li>Moses has some animals killed and their dead bodies burned for God. Then he sprinkles their blood on the altar and on
the people. This makes God happy. <a href="../ex/24.html#5">24:5-8</a>

<p><li>Get some animals, kill them, chop up their bodies, wave body parts in the air, burn the carcasses, and sprinkle the
blood all around -- in precisely the way God tells you. It may well make you sick, but it makes God feel good.
 <a href="../ex/29.html#11">29:11-37</a>
 
<p><li>Have your killed and offered your bullock for a sin offering today? How about the two lambs you are supposed to
offer each day?  <a href="../ex/29.html#36">29:36-39</a>

<p><li>Wash up or die. This is a good verse to use when reminding the kiddies to wash their hands before supper. 
<a href="../ex/30.html#20">30:20</a>

<p><li>Whoever puts holy oil on a stranger shall be "cut off from his people." 
<a href="../ex/30.html#33">30:33</a>

<p><li>Those who break the Sabbath are to be executed. <a href="../ex/31.html#14">31:14</a>

<p><li>God asks to be left alone so that his "wrath may wax hot"  and he can "consume them.  <a href="../ex/32.html#10">32:10</a>

<p><li>Moses burned the golden calf, ground it into powder, and then forced it down the throats 
of all the people. <a href="../ex/32.html#20">32:20</a>

<p><li>God orders the sons of Levi (Moses, Aaron, and the other members of their tribe that were "on the Lord's side") to kill
"every man his neighbor." "And there fell of the people that day about 3000 men." <a href="../ex/32.html#27">32:27-28</a>

<p><li>"Whosoever hath sinned against me, him will I

<p><li>God gives detailed instructions for performing ritualistic animal sacrifices. such bloody rituals
must be important to God, judging from the number of times that he repeats their instructions.
Indeed the entire first nine chapters of Leviticus can be summarized as follows: Get an animal,

    broken, or cut."<br>
God wants us to kill lots of animals for him. Not just any animals, though. God only wants dead, male animals without any blemishes. Don't 
kill any blind , broken, maimed, or scabbed, or female animials for him. <a href="../lev/22.html#19">22:19-24</a>

<p><li>God gives us more instructions on killing and burning animals. I guess the first nine
chapters of Leviticus wasn't enough. He says we must do this because he really likes the smell
-- it is "a sweet savour unto the Lord."  <a href="../lev/23.html#12">23:12-14, 18</a>

 <p><li>A man curses and blasphemes while disputing with another man. Moses asks God what to

"strangers" are to be their possessions forever.  <a href="../lev/25.html#44">25:44-46</a>
 
<p><li>God tells the Israelites to "chase" their enemies and make them "fall before you by the

<p><li>When Moses set up the tabernacle, each of the twelve tribes kills a bullock, lamb, ram, and a kid, two oxen, and five rams, goats,

    thou shalt offer the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt
    offering." <a href="../num/8.html#8">8:8-12</a>
    
<p><li>All firstborn Israelites, "both man and beast", belong to God. He got them the day that he killed every Egyptian firstborn 
child and animal. <a href="../num/8.html#17">8:17</a>

<p><li>"And when the people complained, it displeased the Lord: and the Lord heard it (He had his hearing aid on.) .... and his 
anger was kindled; and the fire of the LORD burnt among them, and consumed them."<br>
God burned the complainers alive. That'll teach them!  <a href="../num/11.html#1">11:1-2</a>

<p><li>"And while the flesh [of the quails] was yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed, the wrath of the Lord was kindled
against the people, and the Lord smote the people with a very great plague. "The Bible isn't too clear about what these poor
folks did to upset God so much; all it says is that they had "lusted."  <a href="../num/11.html#33">11:33</a>

<p><li>Miriam and Aaron (Moses' brother and sister) criticize Moses for marrying an Ethiopian woman and thus breaking
the law of God. But God makes it clear that his rules 
don't apply to his favorites, and he strikes Miriam with leprosy. Notice that 
only Miriam is punished, though both she and Aaron complained.&nbsp;  
<a href="../num/12.html#1">12:1, 9-10</a>

<p><li>God tells Moses that he is going to kill all of the Israelites -- every last whining one of the them, and then 
make a whole bunch of brand new Israelites. <a href="../num/14.html#12">14:12</a>

<p><li>God punishes the children for the failings of their great-great grandfathers. 
<a href="../num/14.html#18">14:18</a>

<p><li>So Moses talked God out of killing everyone. He'll just see to it that no one over 20 years old survives the trip to Israel. 
Their "carcases shall fall in the wilderness." <a href="../num/14.html#20">14:20-35</a>

<p><li>God killed the ten spies that gave a discouraging report with a plague.
 <a href="../num/14.html#36">14:36-37</a> 
 
  <p><li>To further punish the Israelites for whining and plotting against Moses, God will send the Amelekites and 
  Canaanites to smite them. <a href="../num/14.html#43">14:43-45</a>

<p><li>God gives more instructions for the ritualistic killing of animals. The smell of burning 
flesh is "a sweet savour unto the Lord."  <a href="../num/15.html#3">15:3, 13-14, 24</a>

<p><li>The Israelites find a man picking up sticks on the sabbath. God commands them to kill him by throwing 
rocks at him.  <a href="../num/15.html#32">15:32-36</a>

<p><li> Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, the first freethought/democracy martyrs, refused to follow Moses blindly, saying 
        that everyone is holy and should be free to think for him or herself. God killed them and their 
        families for daring to challenge Moses. <a href="../num/16.html#1">16:1-35</a>

<p><li>Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment."<br>
God warns everyone to get away; he's going to kill some more people. <a href="../num/16.html#20">16:20-21</a>

<p><li>"Hereby ye shall know that the LORD hath sent me ... if the LORD make ... the earth open her mouth, and swallow them up, with all 
that appertain unto them, and they go down quick into the pit..."<br>
Moses tells the people that if the ground opens up and swallows the rebels and their families, then you'll know that God's on his side. 
<a href="../num/16.html#28">16:28-30</a>

<p><li>"The earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their houses, and all the men that appertained unto 
Korah ... They ... went down alive into the pit, and the earth closed upon them." <a href="../num/16.html#31">16:31-33</a>

<p><li>"And there came out a fire from the LORD, and consumed the two hundred and fifty men that
    offered incense." <a href="../num/16.html#35">16:35</a>

<p><li>After God killed Korah, his family, and 250 innocent bystanders, the people complained saying, "ye have killed the
people of the Lord." So God, who doesn't take kindly to criticism, sends a plague on the people. And "they that died in the
plague were 14,700."  <a href="../num/16.html#41">16:41-50</a>

<p><li>"Get you up from among this congregation, that I may consume them as in a  moment."<br>
    God threatens (again) to kill everyone (but his special friends, Moses and Aaron). <a href="../num/16.html#44">16:44-45</a>
    
    <p><li>"For there is wrath gone out from the LORD; the plague is begun ... they that died
    in the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred." <a href="../num/16.html#46">16:46-49</a>
    
    <p><li>"Thou shalt quite take away their murmurings from me, that they die not."
God threatens to kill those who murmur. <a href="../num/17.html#10">17:10</a>

<p><li>God threatens to kill those who murmur. To which the people reply, "Behold, we die, we perish, we all perish ....
Shall we be consumed with dying?"  <a href="../num/17.html#12">17:12-13</a>

<p><li>"They shall not come nigh the vessels of the sanctuary and the altar, that neither they, nor ye also, die."<br>
Stay away from holy things and places -- like churches. God might have to kill you if you get too close. 
<a href="../num/18.html#3">18:3</a>

<p><li>God shows us how to make new friends by saying : "The stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death." 
 <a href="../num/18.html#7">18:7</a>
 
<p><li>God describes once again the procedure for ritualistic animal sacrifices. such rituals must be extremely important to
God, since he makes their performance a "statute" and "covenant" forever. Why, then don't Bible-believers perform these
sacrifices anymore? Don't they realize how God must miss the "sweet savour" of burning flesh? Don't they believe God when
he says "forever"?  <a href="../num/18.html#17">18:17-19</a>

<p><li>"Neither must the children of Israel henceforth come nigh the tabernacle of the congregation, lest they bear sin, and die." 
<a href="../num/18.html#22">18:22</a>

<p><li>"Neither shall ye pollute the holy things of the children of Israel, lest ye die." <a href="../num/18.html#32">18:32</a>

<p><li>"This is the ordinance of the law which the LORD hath commanded."<br>
These absurd rituals, cruel sacrifices, and unjust punishments are vitally
important to God. They are to be "a perpetual statute" for everyone on earth. <a href="../num/19.html#1">19:1-22</a>

<p><li>"Take of her blood with his finger, and sprinkle ... seven times."<br>
God's instructions for putting blood on fingers, sprinkling it around, and then burning the dung of sacrificial animals. 
This is something that everyone needs to know about. (That's why it's in the Bible!). <a href="../num/19.html#4">19:4-5</a>

<p><li>"And the Lord hearkened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and
their cities." This verse demonstrates the power of prayer: If you ask God, he will destroy entire cities for you. 
 <a href="../num/21.html#3">21:3</a>
 
<p><li>God sends "fiery serpents" to bite his chosen people, and many of them die.  <a href="../num/21.html#6">21:6</a>

<p><li>God delivers the Amorites into Moses' hands. (You're in God hands with Moses.) So Moses does the usual thing,
killing everyone "until their was none left alive."  <a href="../num/21.html#34">21:34-35</a>

<p><li>God's people will kill like a lion and then "drink the blood of the slain."  <a href="../num/23.html#24">23:24</a>

<p><li>God, who is as strong as a unicorn, will eat up the nations, break their bones, and then pierce them through with his
arrows. What a guy!  <a href="../num/24.html#8">24:8</a>

<p><li>After the people "commit whoredom with the daughters of Moab," Moses has them all killed. Then God tells Moses to
hang their dead bodies up in front of him; God says that this will satisfy him.  <a href="../num/25.html#1">25:1-5</a>

<p><li>When one of the Israelite men brings home a foreign woman, "Phinehas (Aaron's grandson) sees them and throws a spear "through the man .. and the woman through her belly."
This act pleases God so much that "the plague was stayed from the children of Israel." But not before 
24,000 had died.  <a href="../num/25.html#6">25:6-9</a>

<p><li>For impaling the interracial couple, God rewards Phinehas and his sons with the everlasting 
priesthood. <a href="../num/25.html#10">25:10-13</a>

<p><li>God tells Moses how to care for his neighbors by saying: "Vex the Midianites, and smite them." 
 <a href="../num/25.html#16">25:16-17</a>
 
<p><li>The ground swallow Korah and his companions and a fire consumes 250 men.  <a href="../num/26.html#10">26:10</a>

<p><li>"And Nadab and Abihu died when they offered strange fire before the Lord." When you go camping avoid making any
unusual fires.  <a href="../num/26.html#61">26:61</a>

<p><li>In these chapters (28, 29), God provides ridiculously detailed instructions for the ritualistic sacrifice of animals. The burning of
their dead bodies smells great to God. Eleven times in these two chapters God says that they are to him a "sweet savour." 
 <a href="../num/28.html#1">28</a>-<a href="../num/29.html#1">29</a>

<p><li>Under God's direction, Moses' army defeats the Midianites. They kill all the adult males, but take the women and
children captive. When Moses learns that they left some live, he angrily says: "Have you saved all the women alive? Kill
every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him. But all the women children,
that have not known a man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves." So they went back and did as Moses (and
presumably God) instructed, killing everyone except for the virgins. In this way they got 32,000 virgins -- Wow! 
(Even God
gets some of the booty -- including the virgins.) <a href="../num/31.html#1">31:1-54</a>

<p><li>"The prey that was taken, both of man and of beast" was 
offered as a "heave offering of the LORD." <a href="../num/31.html#26">31:26-29</a>

<p><li>"Every man armed for war, before the LORD to battle" <a href="../num/32.html#27">32:27</a>

<p><li>God killed all the Egyptian firstborn. <a href="../num/33.html#4">33:4</a>

<p><li>God tells Moses to exterminate the residents of Canaan and destroy all of their religious symbols and possessions.
 <a href="../num/33.html#50">33:50-52</a>
 
 <p><li>But if the Israelites don't kill them all, then God will make them pricks in their eyes and 
thorns in their sides. And he will do unto the Israelites as he planned to do to the inhabitants of 
Canaan. <a href="../num/33.html#55">33:55-56</a>

<p><li>"The revenger of blood himself shall slay the murderer: when he meeteth him, he shall slay him."
The "revenger of blood" (the victim's closest relative) must murder the murderer just as soon as he sees him. <a href="../num/35.html#19">35:19, 21</a>

<p><li>"But if the slayer shall at any time come without the border of the city of his refuge ... and the revenger of blood kill the slayer; he shall not be guilty of blood. Because he should have remained in the city of his refuge until the death of the high priest"
If the accidental killer leaves the city of refuge and is caught by the revenger of blood, then the revenger can legally kill the accidental killer. 
<a href="../num/35.html#26">35:26-28</a>

<p><li>"Whoso killeth any person, the murderer shall be put to death."  <a href="../num/35.html#30">35:30</a>

<p><li> If you hear of a city where another god is worshiped, then destroy everyone in the city (even the cattle) and burn

<p><li>In the cities that god "delivers into thine hands" you must kill all the males (including old men, boys, and babies) with
"the edge of the sword .... But the women ... shalt thou take unto yourself."  <a href="../dt/20.html#13">20:13</a>

<p><li>"But of the cities ... which the Lord thy God doth give thee for an inheritance, thou shalt save alive nothing that
breatheth." Kill the old men and women, the sick and the dying, the blind and the lame, pregnant mothers, nursing mothers,
infants, toddlers, and babies.  <a href="../dt/20.html#16">20:16</a>

<p><li>If you find a dead body and don't know the cause of death, then get all the elders together, cut off the head of a
heifer, wash your hands over its body, and say our hands have not shed this blood. (That'll do it!) 
 <a href="../dt/21.html#1">21:1-8</a>
 
<p><li>If you have a "stubborn and rebellious son," then you and the other men in your neighborhood "shall stone him

<p><li> When someone commits "a sin worthy of death" that person is "accursed of God" and should be hung on a tree.  <a href="../dt/21.html#22">21:22-23</a>
 
<p><li> If a man marries, then decides that he hates his wife, he can claim she wasn't a virgin when they were married. If
her father can't produce the "tokens of her virginity" (bloody sheets), then the woman is to be stoned to death at her father's
doorstep.  <a href="../dt/22.html#13">22:13-21</a>

<p><li>"If a man be found lying with a woman married to a husband, then they shall both of them die." 
<a href="../dt/22.html#22">22:22</a>

death."  <a href="../dt/22.html#23">22:23-24</a>

<p><li>Legal disputes are settled by a judge who determines guilt or innocence. No lawyers or jury 
        are needed. Those found guilty will be beaten with 40 stripes. <a href="../dt/25.html#1">25:1-3</a>
        
<p><li>If two men fight and the wife of one grabs the "secrets" of the other, "then thou shalt cut off her hand" and "thine eye
shall not pity her."  <a href="../dt/25.html#11">25:11-12</a>

<p><li>God commands the Israelites to "blot out the rembrance of Amalek from under heaven." A few hundred years later
God orders Saul to kill of the Amalekites "both man and woman, infant and suckling."

<p><li>"And the Lord will put all these curses upon thine enemies." See <a href="../dt/28.html#16">Deuteronomy 28:16-64</a> for some 
of the curses God has in mind. <a href="../dt/30.html#7">30:7</a>

<p><li>Moses tells the people that God will destroy
all the inhabitants of the lands that they pass through. <a href="../dt/31.html#3">31:3</a>

<p><li>When God gets mad -- watch out! He'll starve you to death, burn you with fire, and send vicious beasts to
devour you. He'll "destroy both the young man and the virgin, the suckling also with the man of gray hairs." Not even the
helpless and innocent are spared by this psychotic God.  <a href="../dt/32.html#21">32:21-26</a>

<p><li>"For a fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the lowest hell, and shall

<p><li>"Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid,
    neither be thou dismayed: for the LORD thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest."<br>
    <a href="../jos/1.html#rumsfeld">Donald Rumsfeld sent this verse</a> to inspire the troops during the 2003 
    invasion of Iraq. <a href="../jos/1.html#9">1:9</a>

<p><li>God "magnifies" Joshua and promises to "without fail" drive out all the inhabitants of the lands through which they passed. <a href="../jos/3.html#7">3:7</a>

<p><li>"And the city shall be accursed ... and all that therein, to the Lord: only Rahab the harlot shall live." God explains that
Rahab is to be spared since she hid Joshua's spies and lied to those who were searching for them (2:4-5). But why was
everyone else killed? Some of them were probably liars too. <a href="../jos/6.html#17">6:17</a>

<p><li>"And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass,
with the edge of the sword."  <a href="../jos/6.html#21">6:21</a>

<p><li>After killing everyone, "they burnt the city with fire, and all that was therein." Only the valuables (silver, gold, brass,
and iron) did they keep to "put into the treasury of the house of the Lord." <a href="../jos/6.html#24">6:24</a>

<p><li>Joshua says that those who try to rebuild Jericho will be accursed by God, and will have to sacrifice both their oldest
and their youngest sons in its construction. But Jericho still exists today, and is often considered to be the world's oldest,
continuously occupied city.  <a href="../jos/6.html#26">6:26</a>

<p><li>God tells Joshua to kill whoever took "the accursed thing."  <a href="../jos/7.html#10">7:10-12</a>

<p><li>If you happen to see &quot;the accursed thing,&quot; don't touch it. If you do, you, your family, and all of your animals must 
be burned. <A href="../jos/7.html#15"  >7:15</A>

<p><li>"And Joshua ... took Achan ... and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his sheep... And all of Israel
stoned them with stones, and burned them with fire, after they had stoned them with stones." This is because Achan "took
of the accursed thing" -- whatever that means. But why would God require that Achan's sons and daughters (and even his
animals) be stoned to death along with him? The Bible doesn't say. But it does tell us that "the Lord turned from the
fierceness of his anger" when Achan, his children, and his animals were stoned to death and their dead bodies burned. 
 <a href="../jos/7.html#24">7:24-26</a>
 
<p><li>"When ye have taken the city [Ai] ... ye shall set the city on fire: according to the commandment of the LORD.

<p><li>Joshua hangs the king of Ai on a tree until evening.  <a href="../jos/8.html#29">8:29</a>

<p><li>After Joshua kills all the inhabitants of Ai, burns their city, and hangs their king on a tree, he kills some animals and
burns them as a "peace offering" to his warlike God.  <a href="../jos/8.html#31">8:31</a>

<p><li>"And the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear them not: for I have delivered them into thine hand."<br>
    God delivers the Amorites into Joshua's hand (so he can kill them all). <a href="../jos/10.html#8">10:8</a>

<p><li>"And the LORD discomfited them before Israel, and slew them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them along the way."<br>
God slaughters the Amorites and even chases them along the way.  <a href="../jos/10.html#10">10:10</a>

<p><li>"The LORD cast down great stones from heaven upon them ... and they died."<br>
As the Amorites try to escape, God sends down huge hailstones and kills even more of them. <a href="../jos/10.html#11">10:11</a>

<p><li>In a divine type of daylight savings time, God makes the sun stand still so that Joshua can get all his killing done
before dark.   <a href="../jos/10.html#12">10:12-13</a>

<p><li>God tells Joshua to "pursue after your enemies and smite the hindmost of them." (Kick their butts.) Don't let any of
them escape "for the Lord your God hath delivered them into your hand."  <a href="../jos/10.html#19">10:19</a>

<p><li>Joshua tells his captains to "put your feet upon the necks of these kings." He says, "thus shall the Lord do to all of
your enemies." Then Joshua kills the kings and hangs them on trees.  <a href="../jos/10.html#24">10:24-26</a>

<p><li> Joshua, at God's command, kills everyone and everything that he can find (including babies and little children)--
or, as the Bible puts it, he "utterly destroyed all that breathed, as the Lord commanded."  <a href="../jos/10.html#28">10:28-32</a>

and utterly destroyed all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining."<a href="../jos/10.html#38">10:38-39</a>

<p><li>"So Joshua ... left none remaining, but utterly destroyed all that breathed, as the LORD God of Israel commanded."  
<a href="../jos/10.html#40">10:40</a>

<p><li>"All these kings and their land did Joshua take at one time, because the LORD God of Israel fought for Israel."
<a href="../jos/10.html#42">10:42</a>

<p><li>God delivers the Hazorites into Joshua's hand, and he knows just what to do with them: he smites them all with
(you guessed it) the edge of the sword until "there was not any left to breathe."  <a href="../jos/11.html#6">11:6-17</a>

<p><li>"And the LORD delivered them into the hand of Israel, who smote them ... and they smote them, until they left them none remaining."

<p><li>"So Joshua took ... all their kings ... and smote them, and slew them."  <a href="../jos/11.html#16">11:16-17</a>

<p><li>"For it was of the Lord to harden their hearts, that they should come against Israel in battle, that he might destroy
them utterly." Notice that God hardens their hearts so that he can have an excuse to kill them.  <a href="../jos/11.html#20">11:20</a>

<p><li>"Joshua destroyed them utterly with their cities." <a href="../jos/11.html#21">11:21</a>

<p><li>The Israelite spies killed everyone in Bethel, except for the man (and his family) who 
    showed them how to enter the city. <a href="../jg/1.html#25">1:25</a>
    
<p><li>"The children of Israel did evil  again in the sight of the LORD: and
    the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel ... 
    So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years." <a href="../jg/3.html#12">3:12-14</a>
    
<p><li>Ehud delivers a "message from God" to the king of Moab. God's message consists of a knife thrust so deeply
into the king's belly that it could not be extracted, "and the dirt came out." Just another lovely Bible story.
 <a href="../jg/3.html#15">3:15-22</a>
 
<p><li>God "delivers" more folks into the hands of his chosen people. "And they slew of Moab ... about 10,000 men
... and their escaped not a man."  <a href="../jg/3.html#28">3:28-29</a>

<p><li>Shamgar kills 600 Philistines with an ox goad. Praise God.  <a href="../jg/3.html#31">3:31</a>

<p><li>"The Lord shall sell Sisera into the hand of a woman." <a href="../jg/4.html#9">4:9</a>

<p><li>"The Lord discomfited Sisera ... with the edge of the sword ... and there was not a man left." 
<a href="../jg/4.html#15">4:15-16</a>

<p><li>Jael (our heroine) offers food and shelter to a traveler (Sisera, Jabin's captain), saying "turn in my Lord ...
fear not." Then after giving him a glass of milk and tucking him in, she drives a tent stake through his head. "So God
subdued on that day Jabin."  <a href="../jg/4.html#17">4:17-23</a>

<p><li>For murdering her guest while he slept, Jael is "blessed above women." (Hail Jael, full of grace, the Lord is
with thee. Blessed art thou among women....?)  <a href="../jg/5.html#24">5:24-26</a>

<p><li>"So let all thine enemies perish, O Lord." (Let them all have their temples pierced by blessed women.) 
 <a href="../jg/5.html#31">5:31</a>
 
 <p><li>"The children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD: and 
       the LORD delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years."<br>
       God forces the Israelites to be slaves to the Midianites for seven years. <a href="../jg/6.html#1">6:1</a>
 
 <p><li>"The LORD said unto him, Surely I will be with thee, and thou shalt smite the Midianites as one man."
God promises to help Gideon kill all the Midianites. <a href="../jg/6.html#16">6:16</a>

<p><li>"The second bullock was offered upon the altar." <a href="../jg/6.html#28">6:28</a>
 
<p><li>When Gideon and his water-lapping companions blow their trumpets, God forces all the enemy soldiers to kill
each other, killing 120,000.  <a href="../jg/7.html#22">7:22</a>, <a href="../jg/8.html#10">8:10</a>

<p><li>Two princes are killed and their heads are brought to Gideon.  <a href="../jg/7.html#25">7:25</a>

<p><li>For refusing to feed him and his army, Gideon swears that he'll tear the flesh off the elders of Succoth. 
(And he carries out his threat in verse 16.) <a href="../jg/8.html#7">8:7</a>

<p><li>"He took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and with them he taught the men of Succoth." 
<a href="../jg/8.html#16">8:16</a>

<p><li>"He beat down the tower of Penuel, and slew the men of the city." <a href="../jg/8.html#17">8:17</a>

<p><li>Gideon orders his son to kill two kings, but he refuses. So Gideon has to do it himself since his son isn't "man"
enough to do it.  <a href="../jg/8.html#20">8:20-21</a>

 <p><li>The curse of Jotham: "Let fire come out from Abimelech, and devour the men of Shechem." (See 9:57) <a href="../jg/9.html#20">9:20</a>
 
<p><li>God sends evil spirits that cause humans to deal treacherously with each other.  
<a href="../jg/9.html#23">9:23-24</a>

<p><li>"And all the evil of the men of Shechem did God render upon their heads:
    and upon them came the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal."<br>
    God had one thousand men and women burned to death to punish them for supporting Abimelech rather than Jotham. 
    <a href="../jg/9.html#57">9:57</a>

<p><li>"God ... delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they smote them: so Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites." 
 <a href="../jg/11.html#21">11:21</a>

<p><li>"Whomsoever the LORD our God shall drive out from before us, them will we [the Israelites]
    possess." <a href="../jg/11.html#24">11:24</a>
    
<p><li>When "the spirit of the Lord" comes upon Jephthah, he makes a deal with God: If God will help him kill the
Ammonites, then he (Jephthah) will offer to God as a burnt offering whatever comes out of his house to greet him.
God keeps his end of the deal by providing Jephthah with "a very great slaughter." But when Jephthah returns, his
nameless daughter comes out to greet him (who'd he expect, his wife?). Well, a deal's a deal, so he delivers her to
God as a burnt offering -- after letting her spend a couple of months going up and down on the mountains bewailing
her virginity.  <a href="../jg/11.html#29">11:29-39</a>

<p><li>"The LORD delivered them into his hands ... And he smote them ... even twenty cities ... with a very great slaughter." 
<a href="../jg/11.html#32">11:32-33</a>

<p><li>"Her father ... did with her according to his vow which he had vowed." <a href="../jg/11.html#39">11:39</a>

<p><li>42,000 Ephraimites fail the "shibboleth" test and are killed by Jephthah's army. <a href="../jg/12.html#6">12:6</a>

<p><li>"Manoah took a kid with a meat offering, and offered it upon a rock unto
    the LORD." <a href="../jg/13.html#19">13:19</a>
    
<p><li>Samson's lust for the Philistine woman was "of the Lord." It was all a part of God's plan for killing Philistines.  
<a href="../jg/14.html#4">14:4</a>

<p><li>Samson rips up a young lion when "the spirit of the Lord came mightily upon him." Later, when going to "take"
his Philistine wife he notices a swarm of bees and honey in the lion's carcass (a Divine miracle -- or just rotting flesh, flies, 
and maggots?).  <a href="../jg/14.html#5">14:5-8</a>

<p><li>"And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he went down to Ashkelon, and slew thirty men ... 
and gave change of garments unto them which expounded the riddle."<br>
When the Spirit of the Lord came upon Samson, he killed 30 men at random and took their clothes and gave it to the guys at the 
party as a prize for guessing his riddle.<br>
(Samson might have been a decent person if he could have kept the spirit of the Lord off him.) <a href="../jg/14.html#19">14:19</a>

<p><li>Samson catches 300 foxes, ties their tails together, and sets them on fire; the Philistines 
burn Samson's ex-wife and father-in-law; and Samson smites them "hip and thigh with a great 
slaughter." <a href="../jg/15.html#4">15:4-8</a>

<p><li>"The spirit of the Lord came mightily upon" Samson and "he found a new jawbone of an ass ... and took it,
and slew 1000 men therewith."  <a href="../jg/15.html#14">15:14-15</a>

<p><li>Samson, with God's help, kills himself and 3000 Philistine men and women by causing a roof to collapse, 
setting an example for Bible-based terrorism. <a href="../jg/16.html#27">16:27-30</a>

<p><li>After taking in a traveling Levite, the host offers his virgin daughter and his guest's concubine to a mob of
perverts (who want to have sex with his guest). The mob refuses the daughter, but accepts the concubine and they
"abuse her all night." The next morning she crawls back to the doorstep and dies. The Levite puts her dead body on an
ass and takes her home. Then he chops her body up into twelve pieces and sends them to each of the twelve tribes of
Israel.  <a href="../jg/19.html#22">19:22-30</a>

<p><li>"I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout all the country."<br>
    The Levite tells everyone his story (leaving out the part about how <a href="../jg/19.html#25">he <i>gave</i> his concubine to the 
    mob</a> to do with as they pleased), explaining the mysterious rotting body part messages that brought everyone in Israel together.  
    <a href="../jg/20.html#4">20:4-6</a>

<p><li>After the Benjamites refuse to turn over the men from Gibeah (the town that wanted to have sex with the Levite 
but settled for his concubine instead), the Israelites asked God which tribe should go to war with them. God said the tribe 
of Judah should go first. So Judah goes to war, but the Benjamites with their sharp shooting lefties kill 22,000 Israelites. 
 <a href="../jg/20.html#18">20:18-21</a>
 
 <p><li>After 22,000 Israelites were killed by the Benjamites, they cry all day before the Lord. Then they ask God (again) 
if they should go to war against Benjamin. God said yes, so they try it again, and another 18,000 Israelites are killed.  
<a href="../jg/20.html#23">20:23-25</a>

<p><li>Once again all of the Israelites sit and weep before God, and ask again (for the third time) if they should attack the Benjamites. God give them his usual answer: Attack. This time he promises 
(he was just kidding the last couple times) that he "will deliver them into thine hand." <a href="../jg/20.html#26">20:26-28</a>
 
<p><li>God helps the Israelites kill 25,100 Benjamites.  <a href="../jg/20.html#35">20:35</a>

<p><li>The Israelites killed everyone in the city with the edge of the sword.
 <a href="../jg/20.html#37">20:37</a>
 
 <p><li>Another 25,000 Benjamites are killed by the God-assisted Israelites.
 <a href="../jg/20.html#44">20:44-46</a>
 
 <p><li> The Israelites finish their massacre of the Benjamites by killing all the men, animals, and 
     everything they could find in every Benjamite city. Then they burned the cities to the ground. 
     (In this way God helped the Israelites make everything better after the rape and dismemberment of 
     the concubine.) <a href="../jg/20.html#48">20:48</a>
     
<p><li>Here's what the Israelites decide to do. They will go and kill everyone in Jabeshgilead except for the virgin 
women and give them to the 600 surviving Benjamites. <a href="../jg/21.html#11">21:11</a>

<p><li>"The Lord killeth" -- every chance he gets.  <a href="../1sam/2.html#6">2:6, 25</a>

<p><li>"The adversaries of the Lord shall be broken to pieces; out of heaven shall he thunder upon them." If God doesn't
like you, he'll send a thunderstorm your way to break your body into little pieces.  <a href="../1sam/2.html#10">2:10</a>

<p><li>"Because the LORD would slay them." Eli's sons didn't listen to him, because God had already decided to kill them. 
(Which he does in <a href="../1sam/4.html#11">4:11</a>.) <a href="../1sam/2.html#25">2:25</a>

<p><li>"A man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus saith the
    LORD ... I will cut off thine arm... There shall not be an old man in thine house for ever ... I shall ... 
    consume thine eyes and ... grieve thine heart."<br>
A "man of God" tells Eli  that God will "consume his eyes" and "grieve his heart" and make sure that all of his decendants will 
die young" because of the stuff his sons did. <a href="../1sam/2.html#27">2:27-32</a>

<p><li>"And this shall be a sign unto thee, that shall come upon thy two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas; in one day they shall die 
both of them."<br>
God says he'll kill his two sons as a sign to him. (Just ot remind him of the nasty things he plans to do to him and his 
descendants to punish him for what his sons did.) <a href="../1sam/2.html#34">2:34</a>

<p><li>God will punish Eli's descendants forever for the sins of Eli's sons. <a href="../1sam/3.html#12">3:12-13</a>

<p><li>"The two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain."<br>
    God killed Eli's sons as he promised to do. (See <a href="../1sam/2.html#25">2:25</a> and <a href="../1sam/2.html#34">34</a>) <a href="../1sam/4.html#11">4:11</a>

<p><li>God smites the people of Ashdod with hemorrhoids "in their secret parts."  
<a href="../1sam/5.html#6">5:6-12</a>

<p><li>God kills 50,070 men for looking into the ark. "And the people lamented, because the Lord had smitten many of
the people with a great slaughter." <a href="../1sam/6.html#19">6:19</a>

<p><li>"And Samuel took a sucking lamb, and offered it 
for a burnt offering wholly unto the LORD." <a href="../1sam/7.html#9">7:9</a>

<p><li>The LORD thundered with a great thunder on that day upon the Philistines, and discomfited them; and they were smitten before Israel." 
<a href="../1sam/7.html#10">7:10-11</a>

<p><li>"And the spirit of God came upon Saul ... and he took a yoke of oxen, and hewed them in pieces, and sent them
throughout all the coast of Israel." People do the darnedest
things when the spirit of God comes upon them!  <a href="../1sam/11.html#6">11:6-7</a>

<p><li>"Saul ... slew the Ammorites unto the heat of the day." Then he took a little break. After all, killing is
hard work.  <a href="../1sam/11.html#11">11:11</a>

<p><li>To day the LORD hath wrought salvation in Israel."<br>
God saved the Israelites by slaughtering the Ammonites.  <a href="../1sam/11.html#13">11:13</a>

<p><li>"Saul said, Bring hither a burnt offering to me, and peace offerings. And he offered the burnt offering." 
<a href="../1sam/13.html#9">13:9</a>

<p><li>God delivers the Philistines into Jonathan's hand. And his very "first slaughter ... was about twenty men."
Not bad for a first slaughter.  <a href="../1sam/14.html#12">14:12</a>

<p><li>Under God's influence, the Philistines killed each other.  <a href="../1sam/14.html#20">14:20</a>

<p><li>"So the LORD saved Israel that day."<br> 
God saved Israel by forcing Philistines to kill each other. <a href="../1sam/14.html#23">14:23</a>

<p><li>But later, Saul and his army kill all of those who had not already been killed.  
<a href="../1sam/14.html#36">14:36</a>

<p><li>God orders Saul to kill all of the Amalekites: men, women, infants, sucklings, ox, sheep, camels, and asses.
Why? Because God remembers what Amalek did hundreds of years ago.  <a href="../1sam/15.html#2">15:2-3</a>

<p><li>Saul killed everyone but Agag (the king) and the best of the animals. But still God was furious with Saul for
not killing everything as he had been told to do. He said, "it repenteth me that I have set Saul up to be king." 
 <a href="../1sam/15.html#7">15:7-26</a>
 
 <p><li>Saul is rebuked by Samuel for "doing evil in the sight of the Lord" by failing to kill all of the 
Amalekites. <a href="../1sam/15.html#18">15:18-19</a>

<p><li>Because Saul didn't kill everyone as God commanded, God changes his mind about him 
being king. <a href="../1sam/15.html#23">15:23-26</a>

<p><li> To please God, Samuel hacks Agag in pieces "before the Lord" [I bet God enjoyed that!] -- after Agag
pleads with him saying, "surely the bitterness of death has past."  <a href="../1sam/15.html#32">15:32-34</a>

<p><li>After God rejects Saul for refusing to kill
indiscriminately, he sends Samuel to find another king. David is chosen and
anointed by Samuel, and "the spirit of the Lord came upon him from that
day forward." <a href="../1sam/16.html#13">16:13</a>

<p><li>"But the spirit of the Lord
departed from Saul [since he was not murderous enough for God], and an evil
spirit from the Lord troubled him." But if God is good, then how could
he have an evil spirit? <a href="../1sam/16.html#14">16:14-16, 23</a>

<p><li>David kills Goliath with his sling, beheads him, and carries the head back to 
Jerusalem. <a href="../1sam/17.html#51">17:51-57</a>

<p><li>David and Saul have a contest to see who can kill the most people for God, and the women act as
cheerleaders saying, "Saul has killed his thousands, and David his tens of thousands."  
<a href="../1sam/18.html#6">18:6-7</a>, <a href="../1sam/21.html#11">21:11</a>, <a href="../1sam/29.html#5">29:5</a>

<p><li>David kills 200 Philistines and brings their foreskins to Saul to buy his first wife (Saul's daughter Michal).
Saul had only asked for 100 foreskins, but David was feeling generous.  <a href="../1sam/18.html#25">18:25-27</a>

<p><li>"David went out, and fought with the Philistines, and slew them with a great slaughter."  <a href="../1sam/19.html#8">19:8</a>

<p><li>God will wipe all of David's enemies off the face of the earth. <a href="../1sam/20.html#15">20:15-16</a>

<p><li>Saul kills 85 priests of Nob and all men, women, children, and animals in the city of Nob.  <a href="../1sam/22.html#18">22:18-19</a>

<p><li>"David inquired of the Lord, saying, Shall I go and smite these Philistines? And the Lord said unto David, Go, and
smite the Philistines."  
<a href="../1sam/23.html#2">23:2</a>

<p><li>"Then David enquired of the LORD yet again. And the LORD answered him and said ... I will deliver the Philistines into thine hand." 
<a href="../1sam/23.html#4">23:4</a>

<p><li>"So David ... fought with the Philistines ... and smote them with a great slaughter." <a ahref="../1sam/23.html#5">23:5</a>

<p><li>"If I leave ... any that pisseth against the wall."<br>
David vows to will kill Nabal and all his men (or as he put it, "any that pisseth against the wall".) <a href="../1sam/25.html#22">25:22</a>

<p><li>"Except thou hadst hasted and come to meet me, surely there had not been left unto Nabal by the morning light any that pisseth 
against the wall."<br>
If Abigail hadn't come and paid him off, David would have killed Nabal and any of his people "that pisseth against the wall". 
<a href="../1sam/25.html#34">25:34</a>

<p><li>"And it came to pass about ten days after, that the Lord smote Nabal, that he died." This was convenient for
David who then took his property and his wife, Abigail.  <a href="../1sam/25.html#38">25:38</a>

<p><li>"When David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, 
Blessed be the LORD ... And David sent and communed with Abigail, to take
    her to him to wife." <a href="../1sam/25.html#39">25:39</a>
    
<p><li> "And David smote the land and left neither man nor woman alive." (No wonder God liked David so much!)
<a href="../1sam/27.html#8">27:8-11</a>

<p><li>Saul visits a woman with a "familiar spirit" and she brings Samuel back from the dead. Samuel once again
explains that God is angry at Saul for not killing all of the Amalekites. He says God is going to deliver all of Israel
into the hands of the Philistines. (Since Saul refused to slaughter innocent people, God will slaughter the Israelites.
Fair is fair.)  <a href="../1sam/28.html#8">28:8-19</a>

<p><li>"Because thou obeyedst not the voice of the LORD, nor executedst his fierce wrath upon Amalek, 
therefore hath the LORD done this thing unto thee this day." <a href="../1sam/28.html#18">28:18</a>

<p><li>"The LORD will also deliver Israel with thee into the hand of the Philistines: and to morrow shalt thou and thy sons be with me."<br>
God sent a message to Saul (through a dead man brought back to life by a witch) was that tomorrow God would make sure that the 
Philistines kill him and his sons (to punish Saul for not killing all the Amalekites like God told him to in 
<a href="../1sam/15.html#3">15:3</a>).  <a href="../1sam/28.html#19">28:19</a>

<p><li>The Philistine leaders didn't trust David, even though David had committed many genocides for them. 
They had heard about how the Israelite dancing girls used to sing about David's killings, singing, "Saul has killed his 
thousands, and David his tens of thousands." So they worried that David could not be trusted to kill his own people. But 
they were wrong about that. David was always willing to kill anyone at anytime for any reason whatsoever. That's why God 
loved him so much. <a href="../1sam/29.html#5">29:5</a>

<p><li>"David said unto Achish, But what have I done ... that I may not go fight against the enemies of my lord the king?"<br>
David was disappointed. He wanted to go kill Israelites with the Philistines. <a href="../1sam/29.html#8">29:8</a>

<p><li>"David smote them from the twilight even unto the evening of the next day: 
and there escaped not a man of them, save four hundred young men."<br>
David spends the day killing more of those pesky Amalekites. He kills all of them except for 400 that escaped on camels. (See 
<A href="../1sam/15.html#7">15:7-8</A> and <A href="../1sam/27.html#8">27:8-9</A> for the last two times
they were exterminated.) <a href="../1sam/30.html#17">30:17</a>

<p><li>"Now the Philistines fought against Israel; and the men of Israel fled from
    before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa."<br>
    God used the Philistines to kill the Israelite soldiers to punish Saul for not killing all the Amalekites. (See 
    <a href="../1sam/28.html#19">28:19</a>) <a href="../1sam/31.html#1">31:1</a>

<p><li>"The Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Melchishua, Saul's sons."<br>
God had the Philistines kill Saul's sons to punish him for not killing all the Amalekites. See 
    <a href="../1sam/28.html#19">28:19</a>) <a href="../1sam/31.html#2">31:2</a>

<p><li>"So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armourbearer, and all his men, that same day together." <a href="../1sam/31.html#6">31:6</a>

<p><li>They cut off his head ... and sent into the land of the Philistines round about ... and they fastened his body to the wall of Bethshan."
Was this a part of Saul's punishment for not killing all the Amalekites?  <a href="../1sam/31.html#9">31:9-10</a>

<p><li>David tells one of his "young men" to kill the Amalekite messenger who claimed to have mercifully killed Saul
at Saul's own request.  <a href="../2sam/1.html#15">1:15</a>

<p><li>Joab and Abner watch as the young men "play" a cruel game. "And they caught every one his fellow by the
head, and thrust his sword in his fellow side, so they fell down together."  <a href="../2sam/2.html#14">2:14</a>

<p><li>Abner smites Asahel "under the fifth rib." (It seems that in 2 
Samuel this is the preferred place to get smitten. <a href="../2sam/3.html#27">3:27</a>, <a href="../2sam/4.html#6">4:6</a>,

<p><li>When Joab (David's captain) kills Abner (by smiting him under the fifth rib of course), David says that he
and his kingdom are not responsible. The blame, he says, lays with Joab. So David curses Joab, his family, and their
descendants forever. Let them all be plagued with venereal diseases and leprosy, starve to death, commit suicide, or
lean on staves. (The Revised Standard Version translates "leaneth on a staff" as "holds a spindle," apparently
meaning effeminate -- real men don't spin or weave.)  <a href="../2sam/3.html#27">3:27-29</a>

<p><li>Some of David's men kill Saul's son (by smiting him under the fifth rib, of course) and bring his head to
David, thinking that he'll be pleased. But he wasn't. David has the assassins killed, their hands and feet chopped off,
and their bodies hung up (for decorations?) over the pool in Hebron.  <a href="../2sam/4.html#6">4:6-7</a>

<p><li>Whoever kills the lame and the blind will be David's "chief and captain."  <a href="../2sam/5.html#8">5:8</a>

<p><li>"David ... grew great, and the LORD God of hosts was with him." <a href="../2sam/5.html#10">5:10</a>

<p><li>David asks God if he should kill some more Philistines. God says yes, and he'll even help. So David and
God "smote the Philistines" again.  <a href="../2sam/5.html#19">5:19</a>

<p><li>"David smote them there, and said, The LORD hath broken forth upon mine enemies before me."<br>
God helps David slaughter his enemies. <a href="../2sam/5.html#20">5:20</a>

<p><li>"I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut off all thine enemies out of thy sight."<br>
    God was with David wherever he went and killed all of his enemies for him. <a href="../2sam/7.html#9">7:9</a>

    the valley of salt, being eighteen thousand men ... And the LORD preserved David 
    whithersoever he went."  <a href="../2sam/8.html#13">8:13-14</a>

<p><li>David tells Joab (his captain) to send Bathsheba's husband (Uriah) to "the forefront of the hottest battle
... that he may be smitten and die." In this way, David gets another wife.  <a href="../2sam/11.html#15">11:15</a>, 
<a href="../2sam/11.html#17">11:17-27</a>

<p><li>To punish David for having Uriah killed, God kills Bathsheba's baby boy.  <a href="../2sam/12.html#14">12:14-18</a>

<p><li>"He ... put them under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brick-kiln."<br>
    David tortured or enslaved (depending on translation) all the inhabitants of several cities.  <a href="../2sam/12.html#31">12:31</a>
    
<p><li>Absalom has his servants kill his brother for raping his sister. (This chapter, which includes incest, rape,
murder, should be rated NC-17.)  <a href="../2sam/13.html#28">13:28-29</a>

<p><li>"There was there a great slaughter that day of twenty thousand men ... and the wood devoured more people that day than the 
sword devoured."<br>
It must have been a really spooky forest to have devoured more than 20,000 men! <a href="../2sam/18.html#7">18:7-8</a>

<p><li>Poor Absalom gets his head caught in an oak tree, and before he can get free, Joab thrusts three darts through
his heart.  <a href="../2sam/18.html#14">18:14</a>

<p><li>"Then said Ahimaaz ... Let me now run, and bear the king tidings, how that the LORD hath avenged him of his enemies."</i> 
(See <a href="../2sam/17.html#14">2 Samuel 17:14</a>) <a href="../2sam/18.html#19">18:19</a>  

<p><li>Amasa is viciously slaughtered by Joab, who "shed out his bowels to the ground ... And Amasa wallowed
in blood in the midst of the highway."  <a href="../2sam/20.html#10">20:10, 12</a>

<p><li>"Then cried a wise woman out of the city ... Behold, his head shall be thrown 
to thee over the wall ... And they cut off the head of Sheba ... and cast it out to Joab." <a href="../2sam/20.html#16">20:16-22</a>

<p><li> A famine is sent on David's kingdom for three years. When David asks God why, God answers: "It is for Saul,
and his bloody house, because he slew the Gibeonites. "So God sent a famine to punish a kingdom for something that
a former king had done.  <a href="../2sam/21.html#1">21:1</a>

<p><li>To appease God and end the famine that was caused by his predecessor (Saul), David agrees to have two of Saul's sons and five 
of his grandsons killed and hung up "unto the Lord."  <a href="../2sam/21.html#6">21:6-9</a>

<p><li>"They hanged them in the hill before the LORD." <a href="../2sam/21.html#9">21:9</a>

<p><li>"They gathered the bones of them that were hanged ... And after that God was intreated for the land."<br>
God stopped the famine after Saul's two sons and five grandsons were killed and hung up for him. <a href="../2sam/21.html#13">21:13-14</a>

<p><li>"And the LORD wrought a great victory that day; and the people returned after him only to spoil." <a href="../2sam/23.html#10">23:10-12</a>

<p><li>The chief of David's captains killed with his own spear 800 guys at one time. 
<a href="../2sam/23.html#8">23:8</a>

<p><li>"Eleazar the son of Dodo ... smote the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand clave unto the sword: 
and the LORD wrought a great victory that day." <a href="../2sam/23.html#9">23:9-10</a>

<p><li>"Shammah the son of Agee ... slew the Philistines: and the LORD wrought a great victory." <a href="../2sam/23.html#11">23:11-12</a>

<p><li>"Abishai ... lifted up his spear against three hundred, and slew them." <a href="../2sam/23.html#18">23:18</a>

<p><li>"Benaiah the son of Jehoiada ... slew two lionlike men of Moab: he went down also and slew a lion in the midst 
of a pit in time of snow. And he slew an Egyptian, a goodly man: and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand." 
<a href="../2sam/23.html#20">23:20-21</a>

<p><li>God offers David a choice of punishments for having conducted the census: 1) seven
years of famine (<A href="../1chr/21.html#12">1 Chr 21:12</A> says three years), 2) three months fleeing from enemies, or 
3) three days of pestilence. David can't decide, so God chooses for him and sends a pestilence, killing 70,000 men
(and probably around 200,000 women and children). <a href="../2sam/24.html#13">24:13</a>

<p><li>In David's last words, he commands his son Solomon to murder Joab and Shimei.  <a href="../1kg/2.html#1">2:1-9</a>

<p><li>Solomon has his brother (Adonijah) murdered.  <a href="../1kg/2.html#24">2:24-25</a>

<p><li>Solomon carries out the deathbed instructions of his father David by having Joab murdered. 
 <a href="../1kg/2.html#29">2:29-34</a>
 
<p><li>Solomon justifies the murder of Joab by saying that Joab also was a murderer, and that the blood of Joab's victims
"shall therefore return upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed for ever." 
<a href="../1kg/2.html#33">2:33</a>

<p><li>But Solomon is not done murdering yet. He has Shimei murdered -- or as Solomon put it, "The Lord shall return
thy wickedness upon thine own head."  <a href="../1kg/2.html#44">2:44, 46</a>

<p><li>Solomon killed and sacrificed 1000 animals to God at Gibeon. <a href="../1kg/3.html#4">3:4</a>

<p><li>When the ark of the covenant was brought into the temple, Solomon killed 
more animals than could be numbered. <a href="../1kg/8.html#5">8:5</a>

<p><li>When dedicating the temple, Solomon killed 22,000 oxen and 120,000 sheep. <a href="../1kg/8.html#63">8:63</a>

<p><li>"Joab ... had smitten every male in Edom."</i><br>
 Joab (David's captain) spent six months killing every male in Edom. Yet a few years later Edom revolted. (<A

<p><li>"Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam." <a href="../1kg/11.html#40">11:40</a>

<p><li>King Josiah is prophesied to sacrifice the priests of the "high places" on their altars. And he does so in 
<a href="../2kg/23.html#20">2 Kings 23:20</a>. Note that this is a guy who "did what was right in the eyes of the Lord" 
(<a href="../2kg/22.html#2">2 Kings 22:2</a>). <a href="../1kg/13.html#2">13:2</a>

<p><li>"And his hand, which he put forth against him, dried up ... And the man of God besought the LORD, and the king's 
hand was restored him again."<br>
Ever the playful spirit, God withers, and then restores, the hand of king Jeroboam.  <a href="../1kg/13.html#4">13:4-6</a>

<p><li>"A lion met him by the way, and slew him."<br>
So there were these two prophets. The first prophet lied to the second. To the punish the second for believing the first's lie, 
God sent a lion to kill him. Get it?  <a href="../1kg/13.html#11">13:11-24</a>
 
 <p><li>"When the prophet ... heard thereof, he said, It is the man of God, who was disobedient unto the word of the LORD: 
therefore the LORD hath delivered him unto the lion, which hath torn him, and slain him, according to the word of the LORD." 
<a href="../1kg/13.html#26">13:26</a>

<p><li>God promises to "bring evil upon the
house of Jerobaom," saying he will "cut off" anyone "that
pisseth against the wall." Then, after he is done with them, their dead bodies will be eaten by dogs (if they are 
city dwellers) or fowls (if they are country folk). <a href="../1kg/14.html#10">14:10-11</a>

<p><li>"Him that dieth of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat:

<p><li>"When thy feet enter into the city, the child shall die." <a href="../1kg/14.html#12">14:12</a>

<p><li>"For the LORD shall smite Israel ... because they have made their groves, provoking the LORD to anger." 
<a href="../1kg/14.html#15">14:15</a>

<p><li>"When she came to the threshold of the door, the child died."<br>
To punish Jeroboam for making gold calves, God killed his son.  <a href="../1kg/14.html#17">14:17</a>

<p><li>Baasha kills "all of the house of Jeroboam" leaving none "to breath." This slaughter was done "according to the
word of the Lord."  <a href="../1kg/15.html#29">15:29</a>

<p><li>"I will ... make thy house like the house of Jeroboam. Him that dieth of Baasha in the city shall the dogs eat; 
and him that dieth of his in the fields shall the fowls of the air eat."<br>
God says he's going to kill Baasha's family (like he did Jeroboam's). <a href="../1kg/16.html#3">16:3-4</a>

<p><li>"He slew all the house of Baasha: he left him not one that pisseth against a wall, neither of his kinsfolks, 
nor of his friends. Thus did Zimri destroy all the house of Baasha, according to the word of the LORD."<br> 
Zimri kills everyone "that pisseth against a wall ... according to the word of the Lord." <a href="../1kg/16.html#11">16:11-12</a>

<p><li>"When Zimri saw that the city was taken, that he went into the palace of the king's house, and burnt the king's house over him 
with fire, and died. For his sins which he sinned in doing evil in the sight of the LORD, in walking in the way of Jeroboam, 
and in his sin which he did, to make Israel to sin."<br>
Did God force Zimri to burn himself to death? <a href="../1kg/16.html#11">16:18-19</a>

<p><li>"Zimri ... died ... doing evil in the sight of the LORD." <a href="../1kg/16.html#18">16:18-19</a>

<p><li>"He laid the foundation  thereof in Abiram his firstborn, and set up the gates thereof in his

When Hiel rebuilds Jericho, he lays the foundation with the body of his oldest son and sets up the gates with his
youngest son's body "according to the word of the Lord."<br>
Did God want Hiel to sacrifice his sons in this way? Did he make him do it? What does "according to the word of the Lord" mean here?
  <a href="../1kg/16.html#34">16:34</a>

<p><li>Elijah kills 450 prophets of Baal.  <a href="../1kg/18.html#22">18:22, 40</a>

<p><li>"There came a prophet unto Ahab king of Israel, saying, Thus saith the LORD, Hast thou seen all this great multitude? behold, 
I will deliver it into thine hand this day; and thou shalt know that I am the LORD." <a href="../1kg/20.html#13">20:13</a>

<p><li>"They slew every one his man: and the Syrians fled; and Israel pursued them ... And the king of Israel ... 
slew the Syrians with a great slaughter."<br>
The first God assisted "great slaugher" of the Syrians. <a href="../1kg/20.html#21">20:21</a>

<p><li>God delivers the Syrians into the Israelites' hands, and 100,000 were killed in one day. Of those that escaped,
27,000 were crushed by a falling wall. (It was a really big wall.) <a href="../1kg/20.html#28">20:28-30</a> 

<p><li>"A man of God ... said, Thus saith the LORD, Because the Syrians have said, The LORD is God of the hills, 
but he is not God of the valleys, therefore will I deliver all this great multitude into thine hand, and ye shall 
know that I am the LORD."<br>
God kills 127,000 Syrians because they said he was God of the hills but not God of the valleys. <a href="../1kg/20.html#28">20:28</a>

<p><li>"The children of Israel slew of the Syrians an hundred thousand footmen in one day." <a href="../1kg/20.html#29">20:29</a>

    father, I will restore ... Then said Ahab, I will send thee away with this
    covenant. So he made a covenant with him, and sent him away."<br>
    King Ahab is merciful to king Beh-hada. God will later kill him for it. (See <a href="#42">1 Kings 20:42</a> and 
    <a href="../1kg/22.html#35">22:35</a>) <a href="../1kg/20.html#34">20:34</a>

<p><li>There was this son of a prophet that said to his neighbor, "Smite me." But the neighbor refused. 
So God sent a lion to devour him. <a href="../1kg/20.html#35">20:35-36</a>

<p><li>Thus saith the LORD, Because thou hast let go out of thy hand a man whom I appointed to utter destruction, 
therefore thy life shall go for his life, and thy people for his people."<br>
The prophet tells king Ahab that he will be killed and his people punished for not killing Ben-hadad: 
"Your life shall go for his life, and your people for his people." <a href="../1kg/20.html#42">20:42</a>

<p><li>"Thou didst blaspheme God and the king."<br>
Although Naboth was set up here by Jezebel to steal his land, the text assumes that the proper punishment for 
"blaspheming God and the king" is death by stoning. <a href="../1kg/21.html#10">21:10-13</a>
        
<p><li>"Thus saith the Lord, in the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick thy blood, even thine."<br>
God says that dogs with lick Ahab's blood. But Jezebel, not Ahab, was repsonsible for Naboth's death.
 <a href="../1kg/21.html#19">21:19</a>
 
<p><li>"Behold, I will bring evil upon thee, 
and will take away thy posterity, and will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against the wall."<br>
God will "bring evil upon" Ahab and kill everyone in his family "that pisseth against the wall</a>." <a href="../1kg/21.html#21">21:21</a>

<p><li>The dogs shall eat Jezebel."<br>
Jezebel (Ahab's "strange" wife) "stirred up" Ahab to "work wickedness in the sight of the Lord." To punish her, 
God will feed her dead body to the dogs. He also plans to feed Ahab's family to the dogs (if they live in the city) 
and to the birds (if they are country folks). <a href="../1kg/21.html#23">21:23-25</a>

<p><li>"Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me? because he humbleth himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days: 
but in his son's days will I bring the evil upon his house."<br>
Since Ahab humbles himself before the Lord, God decides not to bring evil on him; he'll 
<a href="../2kg/9.html#24" title="2Kg 9:24-25">he'll bring it on Ahab's son</a> instead. <a href="../1kg/21.html#29">21:29</a>

<p><li>"And the LORD said, Who shall persuade Ahab?"<br>
God asks for volunteer among the guys hanging out with him. He wants one of them to lie for him so that he can get Ahab kiiled.

Lord." <a href="../2kg/6.html#28">6:28-29, 33</a>

<p><li>Someone questions Elisha's forecast, and Elisha tells him (indirectly) that he'll be killed for it. (And he is. See

destroyed him according to the word of the Lord."  <a href="../2kg/10.html#16">10:16-17</a>

<p><li>Jehu lied to the followers of Baal so that he could trap and kill them.  <a href="../2kg/10.html#19">10:19</a>

<p><li>Jehu warns his guards saying, "If any of the men escape, he that letteth him go, his life shall be for the life of
him."  <a href="../2kg/10.html#24">10:24</a>

<p><li>Jehu, when he finishes his animal sacrifices, orders his men to "Go in, and slay them, let none come forth. And
they smote them with the edge of the sword."  <a href="../2kg/10.html#25">10:25</a>

<p><li>I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a rumour, and
    shall return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land."<br>
    God will cause Sennacherib to be killed by the sword. (See <a href="../2kg/19.html#37">verse 37</a> where Sennacherib is 
    killed by his own sons while praying.) <a href="../2kg/19.html#7">19:7</a>

<p><li>An "angel of the Lord" kills 185,000 men while they sleep. "And when they arose early in the morning, behold,
they were all dead corpses." I guess they all woke up and said, "Shucks, I'm dead."  <a href="../2kg/19.html#35">19:35</a>

<p><li>"Sennacherib ... departed ... And ... as he was worshipping in the 
     house of Nisroch his  god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword."<br>
     God made the sons murder their father. (See <a href="../2kg/19.html#7">verse 7</a>.) <a href="../2kg/19.html#36">19:36-37</a>

<p><li>Josiah, apparently with God's approval, kills "all the priests of the high places" and sacrifices them to God on
their altars. Note that this is a guy who "did what was right in the eyes of the Lord" 
(<a href="../2kg/22.html#2">2 Kings 22:2</a>).  <a href="../2kg/23.html#20">23:20</a>

Shishak had 1200 chariots, 60,000 horsemen and "people without number" and he attacked Judah and "took the fenced cities which

<p><li>An angel of God kills 185,000 men. "And when they [those killed by the angel?] arose early in the morning, behold,
they were all dead men."  <a href="../is/37.html#36">37:36</a>

<p><li>God will "go forth as a mighty man" who cries and roars, and "will cry like a travailing woman." After he tires of
roaring and crying he'll "destroy and devour." What a guy.  <a href="../is/42.html#13">42:13</a>

<p><li>God makes Egypt, Ethiopia, and Seba pay for Israel's sins. He says that 
he likes Israel better than any other country so he's willing to sacrifice other countries for the 
Israel's sake. <a href="../is/43.html#3">43:3-4</a>

<p><li> God &quot;will bring evil upon&quot; people from which they will not be able to escape. And if they 
cry out to him for help, he will not help them.  <a href="../jer/11.html#11">11:11</a>

<p><li> God forbids others from praying for his victims. Such prayers would go unanswered anyway, he says, 
because he &quot;will not hear them in their time of trouble.&quot;  <a href="../jer/11.html#14">11:14</a>

<p><li> God will punish the people by killing their young men in war and starving their children to death.  <a href="../jer/11.html#22">11:22</a>

themselves.  <a href="../jer/14.html#15">14:15-16</a>

<p><li>God tells Jeremiah not to bother praying for the people. Even if Moses and Samuel (and 
Jesus?) were to ask him to reconsider, he wouldn't. He's going to kill everybody and nobody can stop him!
<a href="../jer/15.html#1">15:1</a>

<p><li>God has it all planned out. He'll kill some with the sword, some with famine, and he'll feed the rest to the dogs and birds. 
Why will he do these terrible things? Because of something a former king did.  <a href="../jer/15.html#2">15:2-4</a>

<p><li> God again threatens Jerusalem with mass destruction.  Here are some of the highlights: 
He will kill children, make more widows than there are grains of 
sand, terrorize cities, and then kill the survivors. <a href="../jer/15.html#7">15:7-9</a>

<p><li> "A fire is kindled in mine anger, which shall burn upon you." <a href="../jer/15.html#14">15:14</a>

<p><li> God tells Jeremiah not to get married or have children, because he's 
going to kill everyone (mothers and daughters, fathers and sons). They all &quot;shall die of grievous 
deaths,&quot; and that shall neither &quot;be lamented&quot; nor buried, but &quot;shall 
be as dung upon the face of the earth.&quot;  For he has removed peace, "lovingkindness," and mercy

<p><li> God will make parents eat their own children, and friends eat each other. <a href="../jer/19.html#7">19:7-9</a>

<p><li>God will break those who worship other gods as though they were made of clay, killing 
so many that there will not be enough room to bury them all. <a href="../jer/19.html#11">19:11-13</a>

<p><li>"Thus saith the LORD ... I will bring upon this city and upon all her towns all the evil that I have pronounced against

<p><li>Jeremiah prophesies his rival's death (along with his famly and friends). <a href="../jer/20.html#4">20:4-6</a>

with a strong arm."  <a href="../jer/21.html#5">21:5</a>

    pestilence." <a href="../jer/21.html#6">21:6</a>
    
<p><li> God will deliver Zedekiah and those that survive the famine, disease, and war into Nebuchadrezzar's hand, 
and &quot;he shall smite them with the edge of the sword; he shall not spare them, neither
have pity, nor have mercy.  <a href="../jer/21.html#7">21:7</a>

<p><li>  God tells the Judeans to either surrender to the Babylonians and become their slaves or die.  
"Behold, I am against thee."  No kidding.  <a href="../jer/21.html#9">21:9-13</a>

<p><li>God will have Jeconiah's enemies kill him and his mother and then 
ensure that he die without leaving any sons. <a href="../jer/22.html#25">22:25-30</a>
 
<p><li> God promises to kill everyone by war, starvation, and disease.  <a href="../jer/24.html#10">24:10</a>

<p><li>Because the people of Judah were unfaithful to him, God will send the king of Babylon (Nebuchadrezzar) to destroy 
Jerusalem and enslave Judah. <a href="../jer/25.html#6">25:6-11</a>

<p><li>God will force "all the kingdoms of the world" to drink "and be 
drunken." Then he'll kill "all the inhabitants of the earth" with a sword. <a href="../jer/25.html#15">25:15-29</a>

<p><li>God is really getting into all of this killing. He roars, he mightily roars, and shouts. He "pleads with all flesh" 
while an whirlwind roars and a noise can be heard everywhere on earth. <a href="../jer/25.html#30">25:30-32</a>

<p><li> God will kill so many people that the entire earth will be covered with their dead bodies. No one is to

<p><li>God will destroy "the peaceable habitations" and make the land desolate "because of his fierce anger."

<p><li> Anyone who disobeys King Nebuchadnezzar will be punished "with the sword, and with the famine, and 
with the pestilence, until I have consumed them by his hand."  <a href="../jer/27.html#8">27:8</a>

<p><li>God kills Hananiah for disagreeing with Jeremiah. <a href="../jer/28.html#16">28:16-17</a>

<p><li> God will send his usual blessings upon his people: &quot;the sword, the famine, and the 
pestilence.&quot; He &quot;will make them like vile figs, that cannot be eaten, they are so 
evil.&quot;  <a href="../jer/29.html#17">29:17-18</a>

<p><li>God will kill those who refuse listen to his prophets. <a href="../jer/29.html#19">29:19</a>

<p><li> God will deliver Ahab and Zedekiah into the hands of Nebuchadrezzar &quot;and he shall slay them 
before your eyes&quot; and Ahab will be "roasted 
in the fire."  <a href="../jer/29.html#21">29:21-22</a>

<p><li>"Thus saith the LORD ... concerning this city [Jerusalem]...It shall be delivered into the hand 
    of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence." <a href="../jer/32.html#36">32:36</a>

<p><li> God litters the ground "with the dead bodies of men" that he has killed in 
his anger and fury. <a href="../jer/33.html#5">33:5</a>

<p><li>To punish the people for refusing to free their slaves, God over-reacts (just a tad) by 
threatening to send the sword, pestilence, and 
famine, saying he'll feed their dead bodies to the fowls and beasts of the earth. <a href="../jer/34.html#17">34:17-20</a>

<p><li> All those who move to Egypt will die by the sword, famine, or pestilence. None &quot;shall 
escape from the evil&quot; that comes directly from God. But many, including Jews, have moved to Egypt 
and most seem to have escaped from God's promised evil.  <a href="../jer/42.html#15">42:15-18, 22</a>

<p><li>God's not finished with Judah. He'll bring more evil upon them. Even those Jews that flee to Egypt will not be spared. 
God will hunt them down and kill them all with war, famine, and disease.   <a href="../jer/44.html#11">44:11-13</a>

<p><li>"The sword shall devour round about thee." <a href="../jer/46.html#14">46:14</a>

<p><li> God plans to "bring evil upon" the people of Elam. He says he'll kill them all with a sword.

<a href="../jer/50.html#30">50:30</a>

<p><li>God's killing rules:<br>
If Ezekiel doesn't warn the wicked that God's going to kill them for being wicked, God will kill the wicked people and Ezekiel, too.<br>
If Ezekiel warns the wicked, then God will kill the wicked people (if they don't change their wicked ways), but not Ezekiel.<br>
If a good person does something wrong after God "lays a stumbling block before him," then God will kill him. "He shall die in his sin" 
and whatever good he has done will be forgotten. And Ezekiel will be killed, too, if he didn't warn the good guy beforehand. <a href="../ezek/3.html#18">3:18-20</a>

<p><li>God will force fathers to eat their sons and the to eat their fathers. <a href="../ezek/5.html#10">5:10</a>

<p><li> God will slaughter
everyone by killing one third with plagues, one third with famines, and one third
with wars. If any somehow survive, he'll send &quot;evil beasts&quot; to devour
them. Finally, after he's done killing, he &quot;will be comforted.&quot; <a href="../ezek/5.html#11">5:11-17</a>

<p><li> God will decorate the land with the bones and dead bodies of those who worship a different god.
  <a href="../ezek/6.html#4">6:4-5</a>
  
<p><li> God makes his presence known by killing people with famine, disease, and war. <a href="../ezek/6.html#7">6:7-14</a>

<p><li>God tells Ezekiel to clap his hands and stamp his feet while saying, "they shall fall 
by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence." <a href="../ezek/6.html#11">6:11</a>

<p><li> God will pour out his fury on
everyone, with pity toward none. By so doing he says that
"ye shall know that I am the Lord that smiteth." <a href="../ezek/7.html#3">7:3-11</a>

<p><li> God's is mad at everyone and no one will escape his wrath. He'll kill them all with war, 
disease, and starvation. "Horror shall cover them" and "they shall know that I am the Lord."  
<a href="../ezek/7.html#14">7:14-27</a>

<p><li> God promises again to slaughter everyone. He says that he will ignore them when they plead with him for mercy. 
<a href="../ezek/8.html#18">8:18</a>

<p><li>God screams in Ezekiel's ears, telling him to round up the six angels ("men") that are going to do God's dirty work. <a href="../ezek/9.html#1">9:1-2</a>

<p><li> God sends a "man clothed with linen" to mark the foreheads of the men who will be saved. Apparently only men are considered 
good enough to keep, the others (unmarked men, "maids", little children, and women) are to be slaughtered. God says he'll "fill 
the courts with the slain" and will have pity on no one. <a href="../ezek/9.html#4">9:4-11</a>

<p><li>"Go ye after him through the city, and smite: let not your eye spare, neither have ye pity." <a href="../ezek/9.html#5">9:5</a>

<p><li>"Slay utterly old and young, both maids, and little children, and women." <a href="../ezek/9.html#6">9:6</a>

<p><li>"Fill the courts with the slain: go ye forth. And they went forth, and slew in the city." <a href="../ezek/9.html#7">9:7</a>

<p><li>"Mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity." <a href="../ezek/9.html#10">9:10</a>

<p><li>Ezekiel tells the 25 men that God is going to kill them. That way they'll know that God is the Lord.  <a href="../ezek/11.html#8">11:8-12</a>

<p><li>"And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that Pelatiah ... died." <a href="../ezek/11.html#13">11:13</a>

<p><li> God will kill nearly everyone in one way or another (sword, famine, pestilence), but hell leave a few men 
standing to declare their abominations among the heathen.  <a href="../ezek/12.html#15">12:15-16, 20</a>

<p><li>God has Ezekiel do another clever demonstration: eat and drink carefully while shaking. That way, when the people see him doing that, they will know that God 
is going to starve them to death, which will teach them that God is the Lord. <a href="../ezek/12.html#12">12:18-20</a>

<p><li>God again vows to destroy those that dare worship something or someone other than him. 
<a href="../ezek/16.html#6">14:6-8</a>

<p><li> God deceives some of his prophets and then kills them for believing his lies. 
<a href="../ezek/14.html#9">14:9</a>

<p><li>When really bad things happen (like you or your children get eaten by wild beasts, get killed in war, get sick and die, etc.), then you'll know that it was God that did it to you. 
And he won't spare children just because there are a few righteous people around. <a href="../ezek/14.html#13">14:13-21</a>

<p><li> God will burn the inhabitants of Jerusalem to show everyone that he is the Lord. 
 <a href="../ezek/15.html#6">15:6-7</a>
 
<p><li>For being such a whore, God punished Jerusalem by starving the Israelites and handing 
them over to the Philistines. <a href="../ezek/16.html#17">16:17</a>

<p><li>After exposing her nakedness, God will give her "blood in fury and jealousy" and strip her naked once more. 
Then he'll have her stoned "with stones and thrust through with swords." <a href="../ezek/16.html#38">16:38-41</a>

<p><li>"The soul that sinneth, it shall die." <a href="../ezek/18.html#4">18:4</a>

<p><li> A son who misbehaves by robbing, killing, eating on mountains, defiling his neighbor's wife, 
oppressing the poor, looking at idols, loaning money with interest, or committing abomination (<a href="../lev/18.html#22">Lev 18:22</a> type 
or otherwise) then that son must be killed. <a href="../ezek/18.html#10">18:10-13</a>


<p><li> God will kill you for making a single mistake; all your good deeds he will ignore. 
<a href="../ezek/18.html#24">18:24-26</a>

<p><li> God will set a fire in the southern kingdom that will devour everything and burn everyone. "And 
    all flesh shall see that I the LORD have kindled it." <a href="../ezek/20.html#47">20:47-48</a>
    
<p><li> God gave the Israelites "statutes that were not good and judgments whereby they should not live." He "polluted" them so that he "might make them desolate" 
and force them to kill and sacrifice their children "that they might know" that he is the Lord.  <a href="../ezek/20.html#25">20:25-26</a>

<p><li> God will kill everyone -- good and bad, just and unjust. <a href="../ezek/21.html#3">21:3-5</a>

<p><li>God is sharpening a sword for the slaughter of his people. <a href="../ezek/21.html#8">21:8-32</a>
 
<p><li>"Thou shalt be for fuel to the fire; thy blood shall be in the midst of the land ... for I the LORD 
have spoken it." <a href="../ezek/21.html#32">21:32</a>

<p><li> God will gather all of Israel and consume them in the fires of his anger.  <a href="../ezek/22.html#20">22:20-22</a>

<p><li> God couldn't find anyone to stand up to him, so he's going to destroy everyone.  <a href="../ezek/22.html#30">22:30-31</a>

<p><li> Two sisters were guilty of &quot;committing whoredoms&quot; by pressing their breasts and 
bruising &quot;the teats of their virginity.&quot; As a punishment, one sister's nakedness was 
discovered, her children were taken from her, and she was killed by the sword. And the fate of the 
surviving sister was even worse: Her nose and ears were cut off, she was made to &quot;pluck off&quot; 
her own breasts, and then after being raped and mutilated, she is stoned to death. 
<a href="../ezek/23.html#1">23:1-49</a>

<p><li>"These discovered her nakedness: they took her sons and her daughters, and slew her with the sword." <a href="../ezek/23.html#10">23:10</a>

<p><li>"They shall take away thy nose and thine ears; and thy remnant shall fall by the sword: they shall take thy sons and thy daughters; 
and thy residue shall be devoured by the fire." <a href="../ezek/23.html#25">23:25</a>

<p><li>"I will deliver thee into the hand of them whom thou hatest ... And they shall deal
    with thee hatefully." <a href="../ezek/23.html#28">23:28-29</a>  
    
<p><li>"Thou shalt ... pluck off thine own breasts: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord GOD." <a href="../ezek/23.html#34">23:34</a>

<p><li>"The company shall
    stone them with stones, and dispatch them with their swords; they shall slay
    their sons and their daughters, and burn up their houses with fire." <a href="../ezek/23.html#47">23:47</a>

<p><li>God gets all excited about cooking with "scum" and human flesh, saying "kindle the fire, consume the
flesh, and spice it well, and let the bones be burned. Her scum shall be in the fire." <a href="../ezek/24.html#3">24:3-14</a>

<p><li> God kills Ezekiel's wife and then tells him not to mourn her.  <a href="../ezek/24.html#15">24:16-18</a>

<p><li> God killed Ezekiel's wife to demonstrate his intention to kill the Israelites' children. And just as God told Ezekiel not to mourn his wife's death, 
God forbids the parents to mourn the death of their children. <a href="../ezek/24.html#21">24:21-24</a>

<p><li> God will kill everyone that claps his hands or stamps his feet "against the land of Israel." 
    When he's done with the killing everyone will know that he is the Lord.   <a href="../ezek/25.html#6">25:6-7</a>

<p><li>"I will execute judgments upon Moab; and they shall know that I am the LORD." <a href="../ezek/25.html#11">25:11</a> 

<p><li>God will send Israelites to slaughter the people of Edom. <a href="../ezek/25.html#13">25:13-14</a>  

<p><li>God will "stretch out his hand" to the Philistines (to kill them all). <a href="../ezek/25.html#16">25:16-17</a>
 
<p><li> God says he will destroy Tyrus. He plans to kill everyone, but he is especially looking 
 forward to killing all of the women. "And her daughters  which are in the field shall be slain by the sword; and 
they shall know that I am the LORD." <a href="../ezek/26.html#1">26:1-21</a>

<p><li> Now God has singled out the king of Tyre for his tirades.  <a href="../ezek/28.html#7">28:7-10, 18-19</a>

<p><li> Watch out or God will make you &quot;die the deaths of the uncircumcised,&quot; which is, 
no doubt, a most unpleasant death. <a href="../ezek/28.html#10">28:10</a>

<p><li> God says that Zidon will know that he is the Lord when he  sends &quot;pestilence and 
blood into her streets.&quot; <a href="../ezek/28.html#22">28:22-23</a>

<p><li> God tells Ezekiel to prophesy against the pharaoh and against all Egypt. God says he will 
feed the Egyptians to the birds and beasts. <a href="../ezek/29.html#2">29:2-9</a>

<p><li> God will punish Egypt and her allies by sending Nebuchadrezzar to &quot;fill the land with 
the slain.&quot; Then he will make &quot;the rivers dry,&quot; sell the land to &quot;the
wicked,&quot; make &quot;the land waste,&quot; light fires, and kill all their young men with 
the sword. <a href="../ezek/30.html#4">30:4-26</a>

<p><li>"And they shall know that I am the LORD, when I have set a fire in Egypt." (The Divine Pyromaniac) 
<a href="../ezek/30.html#8">30:8</a>, <a href="../ezek/30.html#14">30:14</a>, <a href="../ezek/30.html#16">30:16</a> 

<p><li>"Thou shalt lie in the midst of the uncircumcised with them that be slain by the sword. This is Pharaoh and all his multitude, saith the Lord GOD." 
<a href="../ezek/31.html#18">31:18</a> 

<p><li> God will treat Pharaoh like a whale fished out of the sea.  Every bird and beast in the world 
will feed upon him.  <a href="../ezek/32.html#3">32:3-6</a>

<p><li>God will vex the hearts of many people, destroy entire nations, brandish his sword, kill animals, 
and cause floods. In this way people will come to know him (just before he kills them?). 
<a href="../ezek/32.html#9">32:9-15</a>

<p><li>God takes a break from killing people while he kills all the animals in Egypt. 
<a href="../ezek/32.html#13">32:13</a>

<p><li>Pharaoh and all his multitude, along with the uncircumcised, will be killed with the sword. 
<a href="../ezek/32.html#20">32:20-32</a>  

<p><li>When God is getting ready to kill people with the sword, it's the watchman's duty to warn them about it by 
   blowing a trumpet. If the people hear the trumpet but don't "take warning," then God will kill the people but not the watchman. But if the watchman doesn't 
   blow the trumpet when he sees God coming, then God will kill the people <i>and</i> the watchman. <a href="../ezek/33.html#2">33:2-6</a>
   
<p><li>God tells Ezekiel that he is the watchman. So the usual watchman rules apply to him. <a href="../ezek/33.html#7">33:7-9</a>

<p><li>If a "righteous" person does something wrong, God will forget every good thing
that that person has ever done. Then God will kill him for the single mistake. <a href="../ezek/33.html#12">33:12-13</a>

<p><li> God plans some more killing by the sword, beasts, and the pestilence. <a href="../ezek/33.html#27">33:27-29</a>

<p><li>God tells Ezekiel about his plans for the Edomites (Seir). He's going to kill them all. That way they'll know for sure that he is the Lord. 
<a href="../ezek/35.html#2">35:2-15</a>
    
<p><li>"Thou shalt come up against my people of Israel ... in the latter days, and I will bring thee against my land, that the heathen may know me ... O Gog." 
<a href="../ezek/38.html#16">38:16</a>  

<p><li> God will cause each man's sword to be against his brother; he will send disease and make it 
rain fire and brimstone. He says that by doing this he'll magnify and sanctify himself and let 
everyone know that he is the Lord. <a href="../ezek/38.html#21">38:21-23</a>

<p><li> God will have birds and beasts eat human flesh and drink human blood until
they are full and drunken. <a href="../ezek/39.html#4">39:4, 17-20, 28</a>

<p><li>God sets a fire on Magog and feeds Gog and all of his people to the birds and beasts. He did all this to let them know that he is the Lord.
 <a href="../ezek/39.html#4">39:4-7</a>
 
<p><li>After the Israelites spend seven years burying Gog's soldiers, God (somehow) feed their bodies to the birds and beasts and gets t
hem drunk on their blood. <a href="../ezek/39.html#17">39:17-28</a>

<p><li>"They have even defiled my holy name by their abominations that they have committed: wherefore I have consumed them in mine anger." 
<a href="../ezek/43.html#8">43:8</a>

<p><li>God's instructions for ritualistic animal sacrifices <a href="../ezek/43.html#18">43:18-25</a>

<p><li>Don't bring any strangers or people with uncircumcised hearts or flesh to God's sanctuary when your offering him fat and blood. 
<a href="../ezek/44.html#7">44:7-9</a>

<p><li> Stay away from idols or you'll bear your iniquity (i.e., God will kill you). But be sure to offer God lots of fat and blood and burnt offerings.

slaughtered them with the sword, and "made the stink of their camps come up into their noses." Destroyed them like they were from Sodom 
and Gomorrah. And yet they still didn't return to him. What is wrong with people?  </a><a href="../am/4.html#6">4:6-11</a>

<p><li>"Therefore thus will I do unto thee .... Prepare to meet thy God, O Israel." <a href="../am/4.html#12">4:12</a>

<p><li>"For thus saith the Lord GOD; The city that went out by a thousand shall leave an hundred, and that 
which went forth by an hundred shall leave ten." <a href="../am/5.html#3">5:3</a>

<p><li>"Seek the LORD, and ye shall live; lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph, and devour it." <a href="../am/5.html#6">5:6</a>

<p><li>When there is wailing and mourning, you'll know God's been there. <a href="../am/5.html#16">5:16-17</a>

<p><li>God says, "If there remain ten men in one house, that they shall die." <a href="../am/6.html#9">6:9</a>

<p><li>"The LORD commandeth, and he will smite the great house with breaches, and the little house with clefts."</i>  <br>
(God will destroy people's houses.) <a href="../am/6.html#11">6:11</a>

<p><li>Next God sends a fire that consumes both land and sea. <a href="../am/7.html#4">7:4</a>

<p><li>God will kill the house of Jeroboam with the sword. <a href="../am/7.html#9">7:9-11</a>

<p><li>Amos tells Amaziah that his wife will become a whore, his children will be 
killed, and he'll die in a pagan country. <a href="../am/7.html#17">7:17</a>

<p><li>"The songs of the temple shall be howlings in that day, saith the Lord GOD: there shall be many dead bodies in every place." <a href="../am/8.html#3">8:3</a>

<p><li>God will kill so many people that dead bodies will lay everywhere. <a href="../am/8.html#3">8:3</a>

<p><li>"I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your songs into lamentation; and I will bring up sackcloth upon all loins, and baldness upon every head; 
and I will make it as the mourning of an only son, and the end thereof as a bitter day." <a href="../am/8.html#10">8:10</a>

<p><li>"In that day shall the fair virgins and young men faint for thirst." <a href="../am/8.html#13">8:13</a>

<p><li>They shall fall, and never rise up again." <a href="../am/8.html#14">8:14</a>

<p><li>God will "cut them in the head" and "slay the last of them with the sword." Any that try to escape by diving to the bottom of the sea will be bitten,
 at God's command, by a sea-serpent. God will set his "eyes upon them for evil, not for good." <a href="../am/9.html#1">9:1-4</a>
 
 <p><li>God will melt the land with his touch and then drown it in a flood. <a href="../am/9.html#5">9:5</a>
 
<p><li>God will destroy the "the sinful kingdom" and  "all the sinners" among 
his people. <a href="../am/9.html#8">9:8-10</a>

<p><li>Those who bear bad fruit will be cut down and burned "with unquenchable fire."  <a href="../mt/3.html#10">3:10, 12</a>

<p><li>Jesus strongly approves of the law and the prophets. He hasn't the slightest objection to the cruelties of the Old
Testament.  <a href="../mt/5.html#17">5:17</a>

<p><li>Jesus recommends that to avoid sin we cut off our hands and pluck out our eyes. This advice 
is given immediately after he says that anyone who looks with lust at any women commits 
adultery.  <a href="../mt/5.html#29">5:29-30</a>

<p><li>Jesus says that most people will go to hell. <a href="../mt/7.html#13">7:13-14</a>

<p><li>Those who fail to bear "good fruit" will be "hewn down, and cast into the fire." <a href="../mt/7.html#19">7:19</a>

<p><li>"The children of the kingdom [the Jews] shall be cast out into outer darkness: there shall 
be weeping and gnashing of teeth." <a href="../mt/8.html#12">8:12</a>

<p><li>Jesus tells a man who had just lost his father: "Let the dead bury the dead."  <a href="../mt/8.html#21">8:21</a>

<p><li>Jesus sends some devils into a herd of pigs, causing them to run off a cliff and drown in the waters 
below. <a href="../mt/8.html#32">8:32</a>

<p><li>Cities that neither &quot;receive&quot;
the disciples nor &quot;hear&quot; their words will be destroyed by God. It will
be worse for them than for Sodom and Gomorrah. And you know what God supposedly
did to those poor folks (see <A href="../gen/19.html#24">Gen 19:24</A>).
 <a href="../mt/10.html#14">10:14-15</a>
 
<p><li>Families will be torn apart because of Jesus (this is one of the few "prophecies" in 
the Bible that has actually come
true). "Brother shall deliver up the brother to death, and the father the child: and the 
children shall rise up against their parents,
and cause them to be put to death."  <a href="../mt/10.html#21">10:21</a>

<p><li>Jesus says that we should fear God who is willing and "able to destroy both soul and body in hell." 
 <a href="../mt/10.html#28">10:28</a>
 
 <p><li>Jesus says that he has come to destroy families by making family members hate each other. He has "come not to
send peace, but a sword."  <a href="../mt/10.html#34">10:34-36</a>

<p><li>Jesus condemns entire cities to dreadful deaths and to the eternal torment of hell because they didn't care for his
preaching.  <a href="../mt/11.html#20">11:20-24</a>

<p><li>Jesus will send his angels to gather up "all that offend" and they "shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there
shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth."  <a href="../mt/13.html#41">13:41-42, 50</a>

<p><li>Jesus is criticized by the Pharisees for not
washing his hands before eating. He defends himself by attacking them for not
killing disobedient children according to the commandment: &quot;He that curseth
father or mother, let him die the death.&quot; (See <A href="../ex/21.html#15">Ex 21:15</A>,
<A href="../lev/20.html#9">Lev 20:9</A>, <A href="../dt/21.html#18">Dt 21:18-21</A>) 
So, does Jesus think that children who curse their parents should be killed? It 
sure sounds like it. <a href="../mt/15.html#4">15:4-7</a>

<p><li>"Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up." <a href="../mt/15.html#13">15:13</a>

<p><li>Jesus advises his followers to mutilate themselves by cutting off their hands and plucking out their eyes. He says it's
better to be "maimed" than to suffer "everlasting fire." <a href="../mt/18.html#8">18:8-9</a>

<p><li>In the parable of the unforgiving servant, the king threatens to enslave a man and his entire family to pay for a debt. 
This practice, which was common at the time, seems not to have bothered Jesus very much.
The parable ends with this: "So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you." If you are cruel to others, 
God will be cruel to you. <a href="../mt/18.html#23">18:23-35</a>

<p><li>"And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors." <a href="../mt/18.html#34">18:34</a>

<p><li>God is like a rich man who owns a vineyard and rents it to poor farmers. When he sends servants to collect the rent, 
the tenants beat or kill them. So he sent his son to collect the rent, and they kill him too. Then the owner comes and kills 
the farmers and rents the vineyard to others. <a href="../mt/21.html#33">21:33-41</a>

<p><li>"Whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder." 
Whoever falls on "this stone" (Jesus) will be broken, and whomever the stone falls on will be ground into powder. 
<a href="../mt/21.html#44">21:44</a>

<p><li>In the parable of the marriage feast, the king sends his servants to gather everyone they can find, both bad and
good, to come to the wedding feast. One guest didn't have on his wedding garment, so the king tied him up and "cast him
into the outer darkness" where "there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth." 
<a href="../mt/22.html#1">22:1-14</a>

<p><li>The end of the world will be signaled by wars, famines, disease, and earthquakes (6-7). And that's just 
    "the beginning of sorrows" (8). Next believers will be hated and killed by unbelievers (9), believers will hate and betray each other (10), false 
    prophets will fool people (11), iniquity will abound and love wax cold (12). But hey, if you make through all that, you'll be saved (13).  
    
    <p>Only one more thing will happen before the end comes: the gospel will be preached throughout the world (14). Well, that and the abomination 
    of desolations will stand in the holy place (15), many false Christs and false prophets will show great signs and wonders (24), the sun and moon 
    will be darkened and the stars will fall (29), the sign of the son of Man will appear in the sky, everyone on earth will mourn, and then, 
    finally, the great and powerful son of Man will come in all his glory (30).
    
    <p>Oh, and all these things will happen within the lifespan of Jesus' contemporaries (34).
    
    <p>Or maybe not. Jesus was talking about things he knew nothing about (36). (See <a href="../mk/13.html#32">Mark 13:32</a>.)
  <a href="../mt/24.html#3">24:3-51</a>

<p><li>Jesus had no problem with the idea of drowning everyone on earth in the flood. It'll be just like that when he 
returns. <a href="../mt/24.html#37">24:37</a>

<p><li>God will come when people least expect him and then he'll "cut them asunder." And "there shall be weeping and
gnashing of teeth."  <a href="../mt/24.html#50">24:50-51</a>

<p><li>The parable of the cruel and unjust master<br>
The kingdom of heaven is like a rich man who distributed his wealth to his servants while he traveled. He gave 
five talents (a talent was a unit of money, worth about 20 years of a worker's wages) to one servant, two to another, 
and one to a third. When he returned, the servant with five talents had made five more, the servant with two made two more,
 but the servant with one talent only had the talent his master entrusted to him. The master rewarded the servants that 
 invested his money (without his permission -- what would have happened if the stock market went down during their 
 master's travels?) and took the talent from the single-talent servant and gave it to the one with ten talents. "For 
 unto every one that hath shall be given .. but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath." 
 Then the cruel and unjust master cast the servant who carefully protected his master's talent into the "outer darkness: 
 [where] there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth." <a href="../mt/25.html#14">25:14-30</a>

<p><li>The servant who kept and returned his master's talent was cast into the "outer darkness" where there will be
"weeping and gnashing of teeth."  <a href="../mt/25.html#30">25:30</a>

<p><li>Jesus judges the nations. <a href="../mt/25.html#31">25:31-46</a>


<p><li>Jesus tells us what he has planned for those that he dislikes. They will be cast into an "everlasting fire." 
 <a href="../mt/25.html#41">25:41</a>
 
<p><li>Jesus says the damned will be tormented forever.  <a href="../mt/25.html#46">25:46</a>

<p><li>Jesus explains why he speaks in parables: to confuse people so they will go to hell. 
 <a href="../mk/4.html#11">4:11-12</a>
 
<p><li>Jesus sends devils into 2000 pigs, causing them to jump off a cliff and be drowned in the sea. When the people
hear about it, they beg Jesus to leave.  <a href="../mk/5.html#12">5:12-13</a>

<p><li>Any city that doesn't "receive" the followers of Jesus will be destroyed in a manner even more savage than that of
Sodom and Gomorrah.  <a href="../mk/6.html#11">6:11</a>

<p><li>Jesus criticizes the Jews for not killing their disobedient children as required by Old Testament 
law. (See <A href="../ex/21.html#15">Ex 21:15</A>, <A href="../lev/20.html#9">Lev 20:9</A>, <A
href="../dt/21.html#18">Dt 21:18-21</A>) <a href="../mk/7.html#9">7:9-10</a>

<p><li>Jesus tells us to cut off our hands and feet, and pluck out our eyes to avoid going to hell. 
 <a href="../mk/9.html#43">9:43-49</a>
 
<p><li>God is like a rich man who owns a 
	vineyard and rents it to poor farmers. When he sends servants to collect the rent, the tenants beat or kill them. So 
	he sent his son to collect the rent, and they kill him too. Then the owner comes and kills the farmers and gives the 
	vineyard to others. <a href="../mk/12.html#1">12:1-9</a>
	
<p><li>Jesus tells his disciples to eat his body and drink his blood.  <a href="../mk/14.html#22">14:22-24</a>

<p><li>Jesus says that those that believe and are baptized will be saved, while those who don't 
will be damned. <a href="../mk/16.html#16">16:16</a>

Gabriel makes him "dumb" just for asking. <a href="../lk/1.html#20">1:20</a>

<p><li>Jesus heals a naked man who was possessed by many devils by sending the devils into a herd of pigs, causing them to run off
a cliff and drown in the sea. This messy, cruel, and expensive (for the owners of the pigs) treatment did not favorably
impress the local residents, and Jesus was asked to leave.  <a href="../lk/8.html#27">8:27-37</a>

<p><li>Jesus says that entire cities will be violently destroyed and the inhabitants "thrust down to hell" for not
"receiving" his disciples.  <a href="../lk/10.html#10">10:10-15</a>

<p><li>Jesus says that we should fear God since he has the power to kill us and then torture us forever in hell. 
 <a href="../lk/12.html#5">12:5</a>

weeping and gnashing of teeth."  <a href="../lk/13.html#23">13:23-30</a>

<p><li>In the parable of the rich man and Lazarus, the rich man goes to hell, because as Abraham explains, he had a
good life on earth and so now he will be tormented. Whereas Lazarus, who was miserable on earth, is now in heaven.
This seems fair to Jesus.  <a href="../lk/16.html#19">16:19-31</a>

<p><li>  Jesus believed the story of Noah's ark. He thought it really happened and had no problem with 
  the idea of God drowning everything and everybody. <a href="../lk/17.html#26">17:26-27</a>
  
<p><li>Jesus also believes the story about Sodom's destruction. He says, "even thus shall it be in
the day the son of man is revealed ... Remember Lot's wife." This tells us about Jesus' knowledge of science and
history, and his sense of justice.  <a href="../lk/17.html#29">17:29-32</a>

<p><li>In the parable of the talents, Jesus says that God takes what is not rightly his, and reaps what he didn't sow.
The parable ends with the words: "bring them [those who preferred not to be ruled by him] hither, and slay
them before me."  <a href="../lk/19.html#22">19:22-27</a>

Apostates will burn in hell with the other non-believers. <a href="../heb/6.html#8">6:8</a>

<p><li>"Melchisedec ... met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him."</i><br>
God showed his approval of 
"<a href="http://dwindlinginunbelief.blogspot.com/2010/04/abrahams-war-to-rescue-lot.html">the slaughter of the kings</a>" with Melchisedec's 
blessing of Abraham. (<a href="../gen/14.html#17">Genesis 14:17-18</a>) <a href="../heb/7.html#1">7:1</a>

    shall devour the adversaries."<br> God will soon destroy non-believers in a fiery hell. <a href="../heb/10.html#27">10:27</a>

Jesus.  <a href="../heb/10.html#28">10:28-29</a>

<p><li>"Abraham ... offered up Isaac ... his only begotten son." (And this was a good thing? How fucked up is that?) <a href="../heb/11.html#17">11:17</a>

<p><li>The Israelites kept the passover and sprinkled blood on doorposts so that God wouldn't kill their firstborn children (like he did the Egyptians 
in <a href="../ex/12.html#29">Exodus 12:29</a>). <a href="../heb/11.html#28">11:28</a>

<a href="http://dwindlinginunbelief.blogspot.com/2006/08/heroes-of-faith.html">The heroes of faith</a>: Gideon, Samson, Jephthah, 
David, and Samuel. It would be hard to find a more monstrous group than these guys.  <a href="../heb/11.html#32">11:32</a>

<p><li>Everyone on earth will wail because of Jesus. <a href="../rev/1.html#7">1:7</a>

<p><li>Jesus has "the keys of hell and death." <a href="../rev/1.html#18">1:18</a>

<p><li>Repent -- or else Jesus will fight you with the sword that sticks out of his mouth. (Like the limbless knight in
Monty Python's "Holy Grail.") <a href="../rev/2.html#16">2:16</a>

<p><li>"I [Jesus] will kill her children with death."  <a href="../rev/2.html#23">2:23</a>

<p><li>"Thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created." God created parasites, 
pathogens, and predators for his very own pleasure. One of his favorite species is 
<a href="http://dwindlinginunbelief.blogspot.com/2006/06/gods-fiery-serpents.html">guinea worms</a>. <a href="../rev/4.html#11">4:11</a>

<p><li>God gives someone on a white horse a bow and sends him out to conquer people. 
<a href="../rev/6.html#2">6:2</a>

<p><li>God gave power to someone on a red horse "to take from the earth ... that they should kill one another."
 <a href="../rev/6.html#4">6:4</a>
 
<p><li>God tells Death and Hell to kill one quarter of the earth's  
population with the sword, starvation, and "with the beasts of the earth." <a href="../rev/6.html#8">6:8</a>

<p><li>The martyrs just can't wait until everyone else is slaughtered. God gives them a white robe 
and tells them to wait until he's done with his killing spree. <a href="../rev/6.html#10">6:10-11</a>

<p><li>God tells his murderous angels to "hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants
of your God on their foreheads." This verse is one that Christians like to use to show God's loving concern for the
environment. But the previous verse (<a href="../rev/7.html#2">7:2</a>) makes it clear that it was their God-given job to "hurt the earth and the sea"
just as soon as they finished their forehead marking job. <a href="../rev/7.html#3">7:3</a>

<p><li>144,000 Jews will be going to heaven; everyone else is going to hell.  
<a href="../rev/7.html#4">7:4</a>

<p><li>Those that survive the great tribulation will get to wash their clothes in the blood of the 
lamb. <a href="../rev/7.html#14">7:14</a>

<p><li>God sends his angels to destroy a third part of all the trees, grass, sea 
creature, mountains, sun, moon, starts, and water. <a href="../rev/8.html#7">8:7-13</a>

<p><li>"Many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter." <a href="../rev/8.html#11">8:11</a>

<p><li>The angels are instructed not to "hurt the grass [how could they? He already had all the grass killed in 8:7] ...
but only those men which have not the seal of God on their foreheads." God tells his angels not to kill them, but rather
torment them with scorpions for five months. Those tormented will want to die, but God won't let them. 
<a href="../rev/9.html#4">9:4-6</a>

<p><li>God makes some horse-like locusts with human heads, women's hair, lion's teeth, and scorpion's tails. They
sting people and hurt them for five months. <a href="../rev/9.html#7">9:7-10</a>

<p><li>Four angels, with an army of 200 million, killed a third of the earth's population. <a href="../rev/9.html#15">9:15-19</a>

<p><li> Anyone that messes with God's two olive trees and 
two candlesticks (God's witnesses) will be burned to death by fire that comes out of their mouths.
 <a href="../rev/11.html#3">11:3-5</a>
 
<p><li>God's witnesses have special powers. They can shut up heaven so that it cannot rain, turn rivers 
into blood, and smite the earth with plagues "as often as they will." <a href="../rev/11.html#6">11:6</a>

<p><li>After God's witnesses &quot;have finished their testimony,&quot; they are&nbsp; killed in a war 
with a beast from a bottomless pit. <a href="../rev/11.html#7">11:7</a>

<p><li>The bodies of God's witnesses will lie unburied for three and a half days. People will "rejoice over them and make merry, 
and shall send gifts to one another." After another three and half days God brings his witnesses back to life and they ascend into heaven. 
<a href="../rev/11.html#8">11:8-12</a>
 
<p><li>When the witnesses ascend into heaven, an earthquake kills 7000 men. This was the second woe. "The 
third woe cometh quickly." <a href="../rev/11.html#13">11:13-14</a>

<p><li>"The Lamb slain from the foundation of the world"<br>
God planned to kill Jesus before he created the world. <a href="../rev/13.html#8">13:8</a>

<p><li>Those who receive the mark of the beast will "drink of the wine of the wrath of God ... and shall be
tormented with fire and brimstone ... and the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever."
 <a href="../rev/14.html#10">14:10-11</a>
 
 <p><li>Jesus sits on a white cloud with a sharp sickle in his hand. When the angel tells him to reap, he kills all the people with his sickle.
 <a href="../rev/14.html#14">14:14-18</a>
 
<p><li>"The great winepress of the wrath of God ... was trodden ... and the blood cam out of the winepress, even unto
the horses bridles." <a href="../rev/14.html#19">14:19-20</a>

 <p><li>Seven angels with seven plagues are filled with the wrath of God. <a href="../rev/15.html#1">15:1, 7</a>

<p><li>The seven vials of wrath: 1) sores, 2) sea turned to blood, 3) rivers turned to blood, 4) people scorched with
fire, 5) people gnaw their tongues in pain, 6) Euphrates dries up, 7) thunder, lightning, earthquake, and hail.
 <a href="../rev/16.html#1">16:1</a>
 
 <p><li>"There fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast." <a href="../rev/16.html#2">16:2</a>
 
 <p><li>"The second angel poured out his vial upon the sea; and it became as the blood of a dead man: and every living soul died in the sea." 
 <a href="../rev/16.html#3">16:3</a>
 
 <p><li>"The third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters; 
and they became blood." <a href="../rev/16.html#4">16:4</a>
 
<p><li>God gave the saints and prophets blood to drink. <a href="../rev/16.html#6">16:6</a>

<p><li>Another angel tells God how righteous he is because he gives saints blood to drink. <a href="../rev/16.html#7">16:7</a>

<p><li>"Power was given unto him [the fourth angel] to scorch men with fire." <a href="../rev/16.html#8">16:8</a>

<p><li>Those who were being burned to death by God didn't repent "to give him glory." <a href="../rev/16.html#9">16:9</a>

<p><li>"The fifth angel poured out his vial ... and they gnawed their tongues for pain." <a href="../rev/16.html#10">16:10</a>

<p><li>Even after being burned alive, those nasty people wouldn't repent! <a href="../rev/16.html#11">16:11</a>

<p><li>Christians will fight in the war between Jesus and those allied with the beast. <a href="../rev/17.html#14">17:14</a>

<p><li>"They shall eat her flesh and burn her with fire." (Are they going to eat her first and then 
burn her?) <a href="../rev/17.html#16">17:16-17</a>

<p><li>To punish her God will send plagues and famine, and "she will be utterly burned with fire." 
<a href="../rev/18.html#8">18:8</a>

<p><li>God will send plagues, death, and famine on Babylon, and the kings "who have committed 
fornication with her" will be sad to see her burn. <a href="../rev/18.html#8">18:8-9</a>

<p><li>Jesus makes war. <a href="../rev/19.html#11">19:11</a>

<p><li>Jesus' clothes are dipped in blood and his secret name ("that no man knew") is "The Word of God". (I bet you thought it was Jesus!) 
<a href="../rev/19.html#13">19:13</a>

<p><li>With eyes aflame, many crowns on his head, clothes dripping with blood, a sword sticking out of his mouth, and a secret name, 
Jesus leads the faithful in heaven into holy war on earth.  <a href="../rev/19.html#14">19:14-15</a>
 
<p><li>"Come ... unto the supper of the great God." An angel calls all the fowls to feast
upon the flesh of dead horses and human bodies, "both free and bond, both small and great." 
 <a href="../rev/19.html#17">19:17-18</a>
 
<p><li>The beast and the false prophet are cast alive into a lake of fire. The rest were killed with the sword of
Jesus. "And all the fowls were filled with their flesh." <a href="../rev/19.html#20">19:20-21</a>
<p><li>God will send fire from heaven to devour people. And the devil will be tormented "day and night for ever
and ever." <a href="../rev/20.html#9">20:9-10</a>

<p><li>Whoever isn't found listed in the book of life will be cast into the lake of fire. <a href="../rev/20.html#15">20:15</a>

<p><li>All liars, as well as those who are fearful or unbelieving, will be cast into "the lake which burneth with fire and
brimstone." <a href="../rev/21.html#8">21:8</a>
